# Node.js

> *Node*.js® is a JavaScript *runtime* built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Compile Time & Runtime

For C++ 

```bash
clang++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
```

For Python/JavaScript 

```bash
python3 hello.py
node hello.js
```

But why Java also needs runtime environment ?

> The **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler is a component of the runtime environment that improves the performance of Java™ applications by compiling bytecodes to native machine code at run time.

This is all about Node.js
