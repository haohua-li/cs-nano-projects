## 166, Labour's #MeToo moment eats away at Ardern's most prized asset – trust

https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/sep/13/labours-metoo-moment-eats-away-at-jacinda-arderns-most-prized-asset-trust

> New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s credentials at home and abroad as a new kind of leader all hang on her next move

It’s just shy of a year ago that Jacinda Ardern stood in the UN general assembly and spoke in support of the #MeToo movement. There was spontaneous applause from the floor for that small part of a much longer speech – it felt like a significant moment.

The New Zealand leader’s trip to New York attracted the usual grumbles here at home – those who could not quite get their head around the very idea of a 38-year-old unmarried woman as prime minister carped about her decision to take her three-month-old daughter along – but the result was the blossoming of an international media love affair. Baby Neve’s appearance at the back of the UN chamber was just the icing on the cake.

At the podium, speaking on the subject of gender equality, Ardern pleaded for #MeToo to become #WeToo. “We are all in this together,” she said.

Six months later the world watched her response to the 15 March mosque attacks in Christchurch and lauded her for it; another layer was added to her legend. Ardern’s leadership has, all along, been about connection, equality, and justice by her own measurement. That entire fairytale now risks being brought down by a series of bungled attempts by her party apparatchiks to deal properly with examples of the very issue she so boldly addressed at the UN.

It’s pertinent to remind ourselves that before Ardern took over the leadership of Labour just two months before the 2017 election, her party was polling a dismal 24%; an unwinnable position even with a couple of coalition partner opportunities. I remember a very experienced political reporter telling me more than a 10% bump would be unprecedented. After Ardern agreed to stand as leader, the party shot to 37%. Her ascent to the prime ministership prompted regular headlines using phrases like “Stardust victory” and “Jacindamania.”

Since then domestic issues have rubbed away some of the gloss – for example, Labour’s flagship response to a chronic housing crisis is widely regarded as a failure.

But these have been painted as blips by a still-popular government. The boldest of Labour’s promises have always been its underlying strength and power – that this would be a caring and transparent government, the like of which had not been seen in several generations.

It’s a very different Labour party we are seeing this week. The party wing has been exposed as anything but caring and transparent in the #MeToo space, and it’s threatening to bring down not only a number of party officials, but the prime minister herself.

The backstory is only now coming out. As I wrote yesterday, young women were concerned about harassment in the party as far back as late 2017. One woman told the party’s national council meeting about a “troubling culture of bullying, and of sexual harassment and assault”. Nothing was done, and within months Labour was swept up in the first of a series of damaging sexual assault scandals.

Its handling of this first series of assaults, at a Young Labour summer camp event, was heavily criticised but Labour appeared to learn nothing from the experience. Another investigation into “predatory” and intimidating behaviour – by a different man – was launched in February, but not before a survivor group of at least 12 had made increasingly desperate attempts to get help from senior party figures over many months. They tell me one senior female party official even brushed off their concerns with this bit of classic gaslighting: “Oh, that’s just [name withheld].”

The investigation and its aftermath have descended into something close to farce; instead of appointing experts with experience in taking sensitive disclosures, Labour put three of its council members on the panel. The terms of reference appear to have been impossibly narrow and unfavourable for the complainants, an issue acknowledged by Ardern. Several of the group say they gave the panel detailed account of sexual assaults by the man, but the panel members say they “can’t remember” sexual misconduct being mentioned. The accused man brought his lawyer – the survivor group had only each other to lean on.

In June the panel reported back to Labour’s council – no further action was to be taken. The witnesses and complainants never even had the chance to review their testimony. None of them were given a copy of the report. In July they sent their first email to media, naming the man and pleading for help. The email’s second line reads:

Each of us loyal Labour party members but we’re scared of the political repercussions of what we’re about to say.

That statement is what stands out today. Each of the young women I’ve spoken to in the months since that email landed, still feels the pull of loyalty to Labour. They talk about it as a family, how they saw the people who ultimately let them down as “mother and father” figures. One told me yesterday, while she’s relieved to see someone held accountable, the resignation of the party president Nigel Haworth for his part in this fiasco was “like losing a member of the family”.

They are also refusing to condemn Ardern. Her offer to meet with them has left some of these young women “speechless” to think they’ll be given an audience with the leader they view as inspirational.

The group now sees Ardern as the only person who can achieve the change they’re demanding.

But if the past 18 months of full-time work researching and reporting #MeToo issues has taught me anything, it’s that investigations into reports of sexual harassment are routinely bungled.

The fact that this happens everywhere does not excuse Labour. As many have pointed out, our country’s leaders must be held to even higher standards than the rest of us.

Now, we’re all holding our breath to see what Ardern will do. She claims her officials did not tell her of the serious sexual nature of the complaints – fewer and fewer New Zealanders are ready to believe that this week – but whether true or not, this is her mess to clean up.

Her credentials at home and abroad as a new kind of leader – kind, caring, compassionate and honest – all hang on her next move.

## 167, Facebook and YouTube defend response to Christchurch videos

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/facebook-and-youtube-defend-response-to-christchurch-videos

> YouTube says spread of videos of attack was ‘unprecedented in scale and speed’

YouTube and Facebook have defended themselves against accusations that they failed to act quickly enough in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack, arguing that their moderation is as good as possible given the number of videos uploaded.

Facebook said on Tuesday that the original stream of the attack was viewed live fewer than 200 times and non-live by 4,000 people before it was removed from the site.

Copies of it spread rapidly and by Saturday evening the company had removed 1.5m uploads. By Tuesday morning more than 800 distinct edits of the footage had been posted to the site.

YouTube said it had tried to keep on top of the unprecedented number of videos uploaded, eventually going so far as to eject human reviewers from the loop in order to let automated systems take down more videos instantly.

A spokesman told the Guardian: “The volume of related videos uploaded to YouTube in the 24 hours after the attack was unprecedented both in scale and speed – at times as fast as a new upload every second.

“In response we took a number of steps, including automatically rejecting any footage of the violence, temporarily suspending the ability to sort or filter searches by upload date, and making sure searches on this event pulled up results from authoritative news sources.”

The data underlines the difficulty of keeping such content off social networks, particularly in the immediate aftermath of a global news event.

Facebook largely relies on viewers to flag problematic livestreams, and does not employ enough moderation staff to watch every live video as it is being aired.

Chris Sonderby, a Facebook vice-president, said that in the case of the Christchurch livestream the first user report came in 29 minutes after the broadcast started and 12 minutes after it ended.

He said Facebook created a digital fingerprint of the initial livestream, which powered the bulk of the automatic removals and enabled more than 80% of the videos to be blocked before they were publicly posted.

But the technology used to create the fingerprints is fragile and can be defeated by simple methods such as filming the screen and uploading the resulting video. One such recording, tracked by the Guardian over the course of Friday, was on Facebook for more than five hours before being taken down, despite being headlined “New Zealand mass shooting”.

Facebook said by Monday it had recorded “more than 800 visually distinct videos” and shared them with an industry body, the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, to let other companies take them down as well.

Neal Mohan, YouTube’s chief product officer, told the Washington Post that as well as cutting human reviewers out of the loop, the site also turned off a feature late on Friday that allowed users to search for recent uploads, in order to block a route for new videos to be seen by millions.

Both those decisions were still in effect and would be reversed once the crisis subsided, YouTube told the paper.

In the wake of the attack, policymakers worldwide said a failure on the part of social media and other companies to act quickly enough was more evidence that stricter regulation was needed.

Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, called on social media platforms to do more to combat terrorism. “We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published,” she said on Tuesday. “They are the publisher, not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.”

The UK home secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “Online platforms have a responsibility not to do the terrorists’ work for them. This terrorist filmed his shooting with the intention of spreading his ideology. Tech companies must do more to stop his messages being broadcast on their platforms.”

## 168, 'Full force of the law' should apply to Fraser Anning after egging incident, Morrison says

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/17/full-force-of-the-law-should-apply-to-fraser-anning-after-egging-incident-morrison-says

> Coalition and Labor to pass a bipartisan motion censuring the Queensland senator over his Christchurch comments

The Australian prime minister has suggested the “full force of the law” should apply to Fraser Anning after he punched a 17-year-old boy who egged him at an event in Melbourne.

New Zealand has welcomed condemnation of the independent Queensland senator, as the Australian government and opposition prepare to censure him over comments blaming the Christchurch terror attack on Muslim immigration.

The extreme rightwing nationalist senator has placed himself at the centre of political controversy after the Christchurch attack, saying the mosque attack highlighted a “growing fear over an increasing Muslim presence” in Australian and New Zealand communities.

The bipartisan motion, to be passed when parliament resumes in April, condemns Anning for “inflammatory and divisive comments seeking to attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion”.

It notes the comments “do not reflect the opinions of the Australian Senate or the Australian people”.

The motion states that “violence such as that witnessed in Christchurch is an affront on our common humanity” and condemns “an attack on our common values and way of life”.

Scott Morrison confirmed on Sunday that the Australian suspect, Brenton Tarrant, 28, who has been charged with one count of murder in relation to the massacre, will be prosecuted in New Zealand. He also flagged a tougher approach to social media companies, urging them to boost capacity to stop extremist videos.

Morrison said the government’s aim was to “keep Australians together”. “We can all band together, to stand against this hatred and this violence,” he told reporters in Sydney. “And we all stand together, people of many different faiths, or no faith at all, stand together for innocence and peace and for love over hate.”

Morrison said the community was “[bound] together today to speak against the evil and the atrocity committed against Muslim brothers and sisters in Christchurch”.

The Morrison government is attempting to reposition itself against rightwing extremism, cancelling the visa of far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos in the wake of the attacks after earlier allowing him to visit Australia.

The Coalition has a patchy record on confronting white nationalism, after government senators voted for a motion that it is “OK to be white” in October only to later claim this was an “administrative error”.

Morrison himself as shadow immigration minister reportedly told shadow cabinet in 2011 the Coalition should do more to capitalise on concerns about Muslim immigration, comments which he has now denied.

The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the Christchurch event “hasn’t happened in isolation”, blaming “extreme-right politicians in Australia” and “keyboard warriors who hide behind the internet” for fomenting hatred.

“I say to those who perpetuate extreme rightwing hatred … You, by your hate speech, have created a swampland of hatred,” he told reporters in Melbourne.

“You cannot disown what crawls out of your swamp.”

Shorten said Australians should not “retreat back into our own tribes” in response, but rather “choose to confront fear with hope; to confront hate with love”.

On Sunday the New Zealand high commissioner in Canberra, Dame Annette King, echoed the words of the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, that the act of violence in Christchurch is “not who we are”.

“But it’s not who Australia or Australians are either,” she told reporters in Canberra. “The outpouring of support and sympathy and solidarity, affection and acts of kindness from our Australian mates has been just fantastic.”

King said relations between the two countries would not be harmed because the perpetrator “does not represent Australia, he does not represent New Zealand, he is an individual”.

King said that Anning’s comments were “atrocious and we reject them absolutely”.

“We condemn what he said, and I’m absolutely delighted that his comments were condemned, from the very top of government here in Australia and [by] the people of Australia.”

Anning, who entered parliament on the One Nation Queensland ticket when senator Malcolm Roberts was disqualified from parliament, delivered a racially inflammatory speech in August invoking the White Australia policy and using the term “final solution”.

The speech was widely condemned and resulted in the Senate unanimously adopting a motion reaffirming Australia’s commitment to a racially non-discriminatory immigration policy although a separate Greens motion to censure Anning was voted down by the Coalition and Labor for fear of making him a martyr.

On Saturday Anning punched a 17-year-old boy after he was egged at an event in Melbourne.

Police released the boy without charge, although they have said they will investigate Anning striking and punching the boy in retaliation before the teenager was tackled to the ground and restrained by bystanders.

Footage circulating on social media also shows that later on Saturday Anning was confronted at the airport by an unknown interlocutor accusing him of having “no fucking remorse” for “all the people that died”.

“You’re representing Australia … go you sick cunt go,” he said. “You’re a senator of Australia, you’re a fucking shitcunt.”

Anning caught in the airport without his fash backup.This is even better than egg boy. pic.twitter.com/YN53F9oS7G

On Sunday Morrison said he had not seen a video filmed by the perpetrator of the Christchurch massacre, shown by several Australian media outlets, explaining he had “no interest in what he has to say”.

Morrison noted that social media companies had cooperated with law enforcement authorities but “sadly … the capacity to actually assist fully is very limited”.

“We will be seeking … assurances from the social media companies about their capabilities to ensure that this tool cannot be used by terrorists.”

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/27/how-do-i-console-their-aching-hearts-hamimah-tuyans-victim-impact-statement-in-full

> Wife of Zekeriya Tuyan, who was murdered in the Christchurch mosque massacre, spoke at the sentencing of the gunman

Christchurch shooting: mosque gunman sentenced to life without parole


The victim impact statements of those bereaved by the Christchurch mosque attacks have told of shattered lives and unimaginable loss. Hamimah Tuyan’s husband died nearly seven weeks after the attacks, having endured many surgeries. She told the court of the impact of his loss on her and their young sons.

My name is Hamimah Tuyan. I am the widow of Zekeriya Tuyan, the 51st of the martyrs.

No amount of money can bring back the father of my sons and my husband.

I am now forced to figure out how to forge ahead on my own.

I miss my husband’s cooking, his lame “dad” jokes, his light snores in the night, the look that can calm me down.

He was my Imam, my bodyguard, my entertainer, my problem solver, my comforter, my best friend.

You put bullets into my husband and he fought death – 48 days, 18 surgeries – until his last breath.

His status then was uplifted to martyr, from hero, and for me, from wife to the martyr’s widow.

My eldest son has only five years’ worth of memories with his father.

My wee one, much less; not enough.

He asked: “Oumi, why did he kill my Baba?”

You see his father is someone who would not even kill a menacing spider on his bedroom wall.

His friends asked: “Why does his mother pick him up every day instead of his father. Where is his father?”

How would a five-year-old answer that? That his Baba was killed by a man who was radicalised, ignorant and picked and chose from history in order to justify killing innocent people, instead of suiting up and fighting the real enemy.

My son, the elder one, asked: “Oumi is he Isis?”

You think of the answer for that. I know we all know the answer for that. There’s no difference between you and Isis. You both picked and chose the wrong team; do the wrong thing.

To help my children understand I explain to them that the ignorant man, the radicalised man, is pretty much like that boy in their preschool who doesn’t know how to play with other children, who doesn’t speak the same language as them. And so he gets feared. He feared that these other children, the others, would take away their toys. And so he communicates and expresses his fear by hitting them first. My boy got that.

I see the longing in my sons’ eyes as they watch other boys holding hands, tumbling on the grass, reading books, building Legos with their fathers.

How do I, their mum, console their aching hearts?

You see, my sons loved their Baba so much that they will jump on him every day to greet him. They will hug him. They will plant kisses all over him. Every day. It’s like as if they have not seen him for a thousand years. Every day.

Now their Baba will not be here to celebrate their future successes, nor be by their sides to support them and comfort them in their times of defeat. They will not have their Baba to lead them by example and who will impart in them the values of hard work, courage, good judgment and, most importantly, respect for life.

What am I going to say next? You would have heard them many, many times, over and over from my beloved brothers and sisters. But I feel that it is important for me to repeat and reinforce it, for you to hear, for me to remember and for my brothers and sisters as well.

God says in the Qur’an whoever kills one innocent soul, it is as if he has killed the entire mankind.

And you killed 51. They left behind 34 spouses, 92 children and more than a hundred siblings who now have to endure the life sentence of being without their loved ones.

You admitted guilt to 40 counts of attempted murder – defenceless men, women and children as they were praying peacefully in their mosques.

And on top of that you have pleaded guilty to a terrorism charge.

Your heinous acts brought thousands of New Zealanders and millions of international communities together in solidarity with us, the affected families and survivors, and in vehemently denouncing your white-supremacist ideology.

Within months New Zealand’s MPs voted to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons and our prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, launched the Christchurch Call to eliminate extremist content online, backed by many countries including the one that you come from, as well as tech giants like Facebook, Google and so on.

What I have just said might as well have been in your victim impact statement, because we are the survivors. I feel like you are the victim here.

So let this be a lesson for you and for your sympathisers and your supporters.

Let you be a lesson for your sympathisers and your supporters.

Listening to the prosecutor read out the detailed account of your act led me to this verse in the Qur’an from chapter 40 of verse 26. I think you would have read it because you seem to know a lot of Islam, you wouldn’t have missed the story about Pharoah and Moses.

Pharaoh said: “Let me kill Moses and let him call his Lord to try and stop me from doing it, to try and stop me, Pharaoh, from killing. I fear that he may change your religion or that he may create mischief in this land.”

Think about it. That’s pretty much your ideology, right? You wanted to kill the Muslims in my community at least and you challenge us and our Lord Allah and our Prophet probably because you fear that we may change the belief of your people and create mischief in what you think is your land.

That’s your ideology. The bully. The Pharaoh. The terrorist. Violence. Fear. Arrogance.

But here is what Moses said, Moses representing us the Muslim community here: “Indeed I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the day of judgment.”

You wanted to instil fear in us, but think about it. It was your fear and your arrogance that has been the reason for why you are here, there, in the dock and I’m here standing talking to you, being the voice of my husband.

Your honour, there is a community of heroes and only 51 martyrs. He belongs to neither.

He deserves not a life imprisonment of 17, 20, 25 or 30 years, but a life imprisonment until his last gasp, his last breath.

He does not deserve credit for his guilty plea. Surely a heartless murderer cannot expect to gain any benefit from this.

It will be grave injustice, your honour, if he should ever be given a second chance to walk in society again.

The beautiful souls that he murdered, they do not get a second chance.

He does not deserve the privilege of living free again amongst us peace-loving people of the society.

I have faith that on judgment day, justice will be served and that his punishment will represent the people of New Zealand’s repulsion for and denunciation of murder and evil, racist, white-supremacist ideology.

## 170, Daughter of Christchurch victim: ‘My dad is a real hero. He got shot in the back to shield my brothers’

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/16/relatives-those-killed-new-zealand-mosques-tell-of-anguish

> Relatives of the 50 killed at the New Zealand mosques tell of their anguish

Khaled Mustafa’s long journey from the horrors of civil war in Syria ended with a different kind of barbarity in a place he thought would be a sanctuary for him and his family.

Mustafa, his wife and children arrived in Christchurch a few months ago. On Friday he was shot dead along with 49 others attending prayers at two mosques in the New Zealand city. One of his teenage sons, Hamza, is missing; the other, Zaid, was recovering from surgery in hospital.

His wife and daughter were in “total shock, devastation and horror”, said Ali Akil of Syrian Solidarity New Zealand. The family had “survived atrocities” in their home country and “arrived here in a safe haven only to be killed in the most atrocious way”, he added.

Names of the dead and injured began to trickle out yesterday as many people in Christchurch struggled to find words for what had happened. Across the country, people were numbed by the mass killing, the worst in New Zealand’s recent history. At a cordon a few yards from the mosques where the deadly rampage unfolded, people came, one by one, to pay their respects. A few shed quiet tears or spoke in hushed tones, but mostly they just stood and watched.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, travelled to the city to comfort the Muslim community. At the Canterbury Refugee Resettlement and Resource Centre, she told them: “New Zealand is united in its grief and we are united in our grief.”

The heartbreak touched many nations, reflecting the origins of those killed, injured and bereaved, many of whom were refugees or migrants. The places where they or their parents had started their lives included India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Palestine and Fiji.

The first to be formally identified was Daoud Nabi, a 71-year-old who left his home in Afghanistan more than four decades ago. His son Omar said his father had described New Zealand as “a slice of paradise”.

Another brother, Yama, who was running late for Friday prayers at Al Noor mosque, found a scene of chaos, confusion and bloodshed. Outside the mosque, a friend told him: “Your father saved my life.”

But it was only when Yama watched the gunman’s video, streamed live on social media as he carried out the atrocity, that he found an image of his father lying dead. “I had to go back and forward and back and forward a lot, but I knew it was him,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Daoud had “jumped in the firing line to save somebody else’s life and he has passed away,” said Omar. “Just helping people is his main thing. It makes me feel like he wanted other people to live.”

More details of the dead emerged yesterday. Four-year-old Abdullahi Dirie was at the mosque with his father and four siblings. His family members survived, but his uncle, Abdulrahman Hashi, said the boy died in hospital.

Hashi, 60, a preacher at Dar Al-Hijrah mosque in Minneapolis, received a phone call on Friday morning from his brother-in-law, Adan Ibrahin Dirie, who was also in the hospital with gunshot wounds. Four of his children escaped unharmed, but the youngest, Abdullahi, was killed.

The family had fled Somalia in the mid-1990s as refugees and resettled in New Zealand. “You cannot imagine how I feel,” Hashi told the Washington Post. “This is a problem of extremism. Some people think the Muslims in their country are part of that, but these are innocent people.”

The family of Sayyad Milne, 14, described as a good-natured, kind teenager with dreams of being an international footballer, had waited all day for news as to his whereabouts. By evening he was confirmed dead.

“I’ve lost my little boy, he’s just turned 14,” said his father, John. “I haven’t heard officially yet that he’s actually passed, but I know he has because he was seen. [I’m] keeping it together and tears are helping. People are helping. Just by being here, it is helping.”

He was told Sayyad had been lying on the floor in the mosque, bleeding from the lower parts of his body.

“I remember him as my baby who I nearly lost when he was born. Such a struggle he’s had throughout all his life. He’s been unfairly treated but he’s risen above that and he’s very brave. A brave little soldier. It’s so hard ... to see him just gunned down by someone who didn’t care about anyone or anything.”

Sayyad was a pupil at Cashmere high school, whose principal, Mark Wilson, said: “This is an act of terror and hate; we stand in solidarity with our NZ community in condemning this horrendous crime.

“Our school had three current students on excused leave from school to attend Friday prayers at the main mosque. We are aware that two of these students are missing, and the other is in hospital with a wound. A past pupil of our school was also at the mosque and is also missing. We also understand that there were two fathers of students at our school who were both shot in this incident.”

The best response to such a hateful incident was to show love, he said. “This can simply mean being kind and caring to each other, be patient, compassionate, and understand everyone will respond differently.”

Many remained missing, including three-year-old Mucad Ibrahim, who was last seen at al Noor mosque with his family. His brother, Abdi, escaped the carnage while their father pretended to be dead.

“We’re most likely thinking he’s one of the people who has died at the mosque ... at this stage everyone’s saying he’s dead,” Abdi said. “It’s been pretty tough, a lot of people are ringing me asking if you need help. It’s been hard at the moment, [we’ve] never dealt with this.”

Sharifullah Najib, originally from Afghanistan, was at Christchurch hospital with a friend before heading to a school where a casualty list was posted. “We have come to visit people, we have lost many, many of our friends,” he said. “We are not sure who is alive and who is in the hospital. I have three friends inside.” He added: “New Zealanders are supporting us a lot, they love us. They are good people, they are us and we are them.”

Survivors were also in severe shock. A 52-year-old father, Adeeb Sami, took a bullet to save his sons at al Noor mosque. He dived over his sons Abdullah, 29, and Ali, 23, as the gunman burst into the mosque.

“My dad is a real hero,” Adeeb’s daughter, Heba, said. “He got shot in the back near his spine in an attempt to shield my brothers, but he didn’t let anything happen to them.” Adeeb was rushed to hospital where he underwent surgery to remove the bullet.

“I spoke to dad,” Heba said. “He sounded weak and appeared inconsolable. My family survived the attack, but many of our friends didn’t.”

Around the country, New Zealanders visited mosques yesterday to show solidarity and to bring flowers and messages of support. “This is your home and you should have been safe here,” one of the messages said. “Sending your souls love, happiness and peace.”

The mood was “sombre, shocked, but not fearful,” said a man who attended the Wellington Islamic community mosque in Kilbirnie. A photo he took of the outside the building showed messages scrawled inside love hearts in support of Muslims.

“The thing that struck me most was actually the kids,” he said. “Maybe they don’t understand the full gravity, but they were there drawing their hearts out.”

Paying his respects near al Noor mosque, Egen Isaac said: “My heart and soul is in grief. I just feel astonished and grieved. This is the first time something like this has happened here, and I hope the last time it happens here or anywhere.”

## 171, Police declare stabbing in Surrey a terrorism incident

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/17/oldham-man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-sending-malicious-communications

> Man held over attempted murder after suspected far right-inspired attack in Stanwell

Police have launched an investigation into a suspected far right-inspired terror attack after a teenager was stabbed and a 50-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

The suspect was detained by Surrey police in Stanwell, near Heathrow airport, after reports were received on Saturday night that a man had been stabbed and the alleged attacker was wielding a knife and baseball bat and apparently shouting racist comments.

The 19-year-old victim sustained non-life threatening injuries and was taken to hospital, where he remains.

The attack was one of a number of suspected far-right incidents reported over the weekend across England, including messages posted on social media and graffiti in support of the New Zealand mosque shootings. It is not known whether the stabbing in Stanwell was inspired by the attack in Christchurch, which claimed 50 lives.

The Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Neil Basu, who is the head of counter-terrorism policing, said: “Whilst this investigation is still in its infancy, it has hallmarks of a terror event, inspired by the far right, and therefore it has been declared a terrorism incident.”

He added: “Police are committed to tackling all forms of toxic extremist ideology, which has the potential to threaten public safety and security.”

Surrey police responded to the incident and then referred it to detectives in counter-terrorism policing. The decision that it should be treated as a terrorist incident was made by commander Dean Haydon, senior national co-ordinator for counter terrorism.

The prime minister tweeted:

My thanks to the emergency services for their handling of the terrorist incident in Stanwell. My thoughts are with the injured man, and his family and friends. Vile, hateful far-right extremism has no place in our society.

The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said in a statement: “We must stand together as a society and reject the terrorists and extremists who seek to divide us. Now’s the moment for us all to challenge the hatred, ignorance and violence they peddle and stand up for the kind of country we are and want to be.”

He added: “I’m determined that every individual and community should feel safe to live their lives. To any communities who are feeling vulnerable and under threat I say we are with you. You benefit our country, you are part of our country, part of us.”

Counter terrorism officials have warned for months about a growing threat of far right violence in the UK.

In a separate incident at the weekend, two people were arrested in Rochdale after a taxi driver was allegedly threatened by members of the public who referred to the New Zealand mosque attacks.

A man, 33, and woman, 34, were arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences after the incident in the early hours of Sunday, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said.

Officers attended the scene in Queensway shortly before 12.20am in response to “a report of a taxi driver being abused and threatened by members of the public who were referencing the terrorist attacks in New Zealand”, the force added.

Separately, a 38-year-old woman from Rochdale was arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence after posting comments online about the mass shootings.

They are to be interviewed by detectives on Sunday.

These arrests follow that of a man from Oldham on Saturday for allegedly posting comments on social media supporting the killings.

The 24-year-old was arrested on suspicion of sending malicious communications on Saturday afternoon, GMP said.

Fifty people were killed in the shootings at two mosques in New Zealand on Friday.

The man suspected of carrying out and livestreaming the attacks, Brenton Tarrant, 28, appeared in court in Christchurch on Saturday charged with one count of murder and was remanded until 5 April. Police said further charges were expected to follow.

GMP’s temporary assistant chief constable, Russ Jackson, said: “The events which happened two days ago in New Zealand continue to cause huge upset with people of all faiths from across Greater Manchester.

“Over the weekend we have had, however, a small number of incidents where people have either posted or made remarks referencing the horrible events in New Zealand, particularly online where people often think it is acceptable to abuse others.

“People are entitled to free speech and this is always respected, however, where this crosses the boundary into criminal offences, let me be really clear, we will make arrests and if the evidence is there we will seek the prosecution of those involved.”

The alleged Christchurch mosque gunman sent a “manifesto” to the office of the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, minutes before the terrorist attack, she has said.

Her office was among more than 30 New Zealand parliamentary email addresses that received the document on Friday. The document did not include a location or details about the attack.

Good morning. Madelyn Train – whose parents killed two Queensland police officers and a neighbour at a remote property last month – has spoken to Guardian Australia about her mother, father and uncle’s spiral into conspiracy theories before they committed their “evil” crime. Nathaniel, Stacey and Gareth Train were killed by police in the incident that left six people dead at Wieambilla – but before that, their daughter says, she had to mute notifications from them and grew concerned for their mental health.

Elsewhere, 10 people are dead after a mass shooting at a dance studio in California, and Queensland will join NSW in banning a controversial AI chat website in schools.

Wieambilla shooting | A woman whose parents killed two Queensland police officers and a neighbour before dying at a remote property has spoken for the first time in a Guardian Australian interview about their descent into conspiracy theories and ultimately, violence.

Exclusive | Queensland will join NSW in banning access to the ChatGPT AI tool in state schools, though artificial intelligence experts have questioned how effective such a strategy is.

Stranded at sea | Guardian Australia has spoken with more than a dozen women sailors who say they have had negative – sometimes terrifying – experiences, including being sexually harassed and assaulted, after meeting skippers through popular sailing websites.

Guest workers | Guest workers from Pacific Island countries will soon be able to relocate their families to Australia, but there are already concerns over “red flags” in the current design of the scheme that may make it unviable.

Camper killings | A man accused of murdering two campers in a remote part of alpine Victoria returns to court today, with a decision due on the release of “explosive” material and evidence likely from the detective in charge of the investigation.

California shooting | Five women and five men are dead, with a gunman still at large, after a mass shooting at a ballroom dance studio in Monterey Park, near Los Angeles. The horror unfolded close to a lunar new year festival.

Joe Biden | A new search of President Joe Biden’s home in Wilmington, Delaware by the US justice department found six more items, including documents with classification markings, a lawyer for the president said. Meanwhile, there are women’s marches happening across the US on the 50th anniversary of Roe v Wade.

Israel protests| An estimated 100,000 people took to the streets of Tel Aviv in what protesters described as a “fight for Israel’s destiny” over sweeping judicial changes proposed by the new far-right government.

George Santos | The debate over the embattled US congressman’s real name is just one strand in a web of deceit that critics say shows the party of Abraham Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower has lost its moral compass.

Super-rich | Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning Keynesian economist, has called for the super-rich to be subjected to taxes as high as 70% to help tackle widening inequality.

Her own kind of leader – the legacy of Jacinda Ardern

The outgoing New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern drew admiration around the world with her signature mixture of empathy and strength – but to her critics, Ardern’s soaring rhetoric was not always backed by desired legislative reforms. The Guardian’s Aotearoa correspondent Tess McClure explores Ardern’s shock resignation and the legacy she leaves behind.

A Guardian Australian exclusive reveals that online bullying among children is reaching “concerning levels”, according to Australia’s eSafety commissioner. The agency is investigating nearly 1,700 cyberbullying complaints and has asked social media companies to remove offensive content more than 500 times in a year.

Australia is now competitive with the United States when it comes to a per capita comparison of how much cosmetic “work” we’re getting done, Van Badham writes. But, she says, rational appraisal suggests the motivation for surgical de-ageing is “based in an increasingly outdated understanding of what youth represents.” In short: when has getting older ever looked this fun?

## 173, Christchurch royal commission extended after receiving more than 1,000 submissions

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/13/christchurch-royal-commission-extended-after-receiving-more-than-1000-submissions

> Minister says inquiry into whether New Zealand mosque attacks could have been prevented will get an extra $3m in funding

A major investigation into whether the Christchurch mosque attacks could have been prevented will be given months longer to produce its final report, New Zealand’s government has said.

Tracey Martin, the internal affairs minister, said on Wednesday the inquiry would now report back on 30 April 2020 instead of 10 December, after an extension was requested by those running it and the Muslim community also raised concerns about its eight-month timeframe.

The investigation has been plagued by criticism that it would be rushed to conclusions and did not have time to properly consult Muslims and survivors of the shootings.

There had been “significant public interest” in the inquiry, said Martin in a statement – citing more than 1,100 public submissions it had received to date.

“The public, through the royal commission, deserves to know what the relevant state sector agencies knew about the individual’s activities before the attack, what, if anything, they did with that information, what measures agencies could have taken to prevent the attack, and what measures agencies should take to prevent such attacks in the future,” she said.

The commission will also receive an extra NZ$3m to conduct the longer inquiry.

Fifty-one Muslims were killed and dozens more wounded in the attacks on two mosques during Friday prayers in the South Island city on 15 March. An Australian man has pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism, murder and attempted murder, and will stand trial in June next year.

When Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, announced the royal commission in March, she promised answers by the end of the year about whether the attacks could have been prevented. The commission would also investigate whether disproportionate attention was paid to Muslim communities by New Zealand’s security services – at the expense of an examination of white supremacist threats.

The suspect, an Australian who had earlier moved to New Zealand, appeared to have posted footage of the attack and a manifesto online, in which he claimed he was a white supremacist. He had also obtained a New Zealand gun licence and a cache of weapons.

Muslim groups in New Zealand have been uneasy about the inquiry from the start, saying they were not consulted properly about its scope and were worried that too much of it would happen behind closed doors. They have said they were included in the process too late to have a say in how the inquiry – which is independent of government – would question government agencies about their actions.

## 174, New Zealand police to start armed patrols after Christchurch massacre

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/new-zealand-police-to-start-armed-patrols-after-christchurch-massacre

> Move comes seven months after 51 people were killed at two mosques in the country’s worst peacetime shooting

New Zealand officials have said armed police will patrol parts of the country in a trial project following heightened security concerns after the mass shooting in Christchurch in March that killed 51 people.

New Zealand, like the United Kingdom and Norway, is one of the few countries where police do not carry guns while on general duty. However handguns, rifles and Tasers are kept in their vehicles and can be used with a supervisor’s permission.

Serious crime is relatively unusual in New Zealand although frontline police were armed for several weeks following the massacre by a suspected white supremacist at two mosques in Christchurch on 15 March.

The attack sparked a debate on whether all police should carry firearms.

“Following the events of March 15 in Christchurch our operating environment has changed,” said Mike Bush, the police commissioner.

“Police must ensure our people are equipped and enabled to perform their roles safely and to ensure our communities are, and feel, safe. This means having the right people with the right tools, skills and knowledge ready to respond at all times,” he said.

The Armed Response Teams will be rolled out in Manukau county in Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, and Waikato and Canterbury on 28 October for a six-month trial.

They will be routinely armed, equipped, mobile and ready to support frontline police officers at incidents that require enhanced tactical capabilities, Bush said.

He said there was no immediate threat.

The Australian national Brenton Tarrant has been charged over the attack in Christchurch, New Zealand’s worst peacetime shooting. Tarrant has pleaded not guilty to 92 charges against him and faces trial in May.

Threat levels have been heightened around the country since the Christchurch attack and 1,400 firearms have been seized from offenders since March.

The police minister Stuart Nash said the move did not mean police would be armed routinely. “The three areas have been selected for the trial because of the incidence of crimes involving armed offenders,” Nash said.

“Police turn up to some callouts with no knowledge of what they are walking into. Every month police turn up to 200 incidents where a firearm is involved.”

New Zealanders must have a gun licence to own a firearm. There are an estimated 1.5m guns in the country.

The government banned military-style semi-automatic and other high-calibre guns within weeks of the Christchurch shooting and also introduced a gun amnesty scheme. More than 29,000 firearms have been collected so far, according to statistics provided on the police website.

## 175, Jacinda Ardern bans all military-style semi-automatic guns and assault rifles – as it happened

How was the threat of from the far-right missed?
Explainer: how are New Zealand’s gun laws changing?


We’re going to wrap up the blog now, you can see our full story about the gun laws announcement here.

A reminder of what happened this afternoon:

Preparations are underway at Al Noor mosque for commemorations tomorrow – a week after the horrific attack.

The fire department is at Al Noor mosque in Christchurch removing the black forensic plastic. Cleaners have been in all day in preparation for tomorrow’s service, although I understand the service will be held in the park opposite because so many people are planning to attend.

The midday prayer is at 1.37pm tomorrow. The call to prayer will be broadcast nationally at 1.30pm with a 2 minute silence to follow.

A nationwide reflection for those killed in the Christchurch terror attack will be held tomorrow, Friday 22 March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced.

The Muslim Call to Prayer at 1.30pm will be followed by a two-minute silence at 1.32pm, at Hagley Park, opposite the Al Noor Mosque in Deans Ave, Christchurch. This will be broadcast widely with New Zealanders encouraged to join in wherever they may be.

“I know many New Zealanders wish to mark the week that has passed since the terrorist attack and to support the Muslim community as they return to mosques,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“How we choose to reflect during the silence will be different for each of us. Everyone should do what feels right for them, wherever they are – at home, at work, at school.

“Planning is also continuing for a National Memorial Service, which will be held later next week.

“While it will be in Christchurch, we’re looking at how we can involve the rest of New Zealand.

“I appreciate there is significant interest in this Service from throughout New Zealand and internationally, and we will continue to work closely with the local Muslim community, Ngāi Tahu, FIANZ and Christchurch City Council to provide more information as soon as we can.

“As a nation, as one, we will pay our respects to those who died in Christchurch,” Jacinda Ardern said.

Police have issued an apologising after wrongly listing a woman as the named murder victim of the mosque shootings when she was actually alive.

The alleged gunman appeared in court last week where he faced one charge of murder, for a woman whose name was suppressed. Further charges are expected to be laid in time.

The woman was connected to the shootings, but was still alive. Police say they have spoken to her and apologised and the charge sheet will be amended.

“An error was made in the charging document prepared for the first court appearance of the man charged with murder in relation to the Christchurch terror attacks. The error saw an incorrect victim name included in the charging document,” said a NZ police spokesperson.

“We have spoken with the person incorrectly named on the charging document and apologised.

“The charge sheet will be amended.

“New Zealand Police regret this error and apologies for any harm caused by the mistake.”

The mistake was spotted by a reporter for Stuff when they were trying to add up the number of those killed and kept reaching a total of 51 names – including the woman on the charge sheet – though police insisted the total was 50. They discovered the error was due to the named woman being alive.

Sandy Hook happened 6 years ago and we can’t even get the Senate to hold a vote on universal background checks w/ #HR8.Christchurch happened, and within days New Zealand acted to get weapons of war out of the consumer market.This is what leadership looks like ⬇️ https://t.co/TcdR63anBt

Underneath Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet there has been some heated discussion about gun ownership. This exchange is interesting:

I am a NZ firearms licence holder, I've served in our military. Keep your second amendment, we don't want it. There is no need for any civilian to own the weapons that are being banned. Freedom from being shot is more important than the freedom to own a deadly toy.

An update from David Meates, CEO of Canterbury District Health Board, where 28 people remain in hospital. His statement is below:

Twenty-eight people who were injured in Friday’s shootings are still in Christchurch Hospital, with six remaining in critical condition in intensive care.

One more person was well enough to be discharged from hospital with appropriate community supports, and two others have improved enough to be moved from ICU to other wards.

One four-year-old girl is still in a critical condition in Starship Hospital in Auckland and her father is in a stable condition in nearby Auckland City Hospital.

The people injured in the mosque attacks are still our priority for specialist care, which for some includes follow-up surgery and although we are closer to being able to resume our planned surgery schedule we will still need to postpone some surgeries for the remainder of this week to free up theatre space and surgical teams.

Anyone affected by rescheduling will be contacted individually, and we will be apologising for the delay and thanking them for their understanding.

As yesterday, most appointments at Christchurch Outpatients are going ahead as planned. If your appointment has to be postponed, we will contact you directly – any changes to our scheduling is purely to free-up key staff to support.

Meanwhile in Christchurch the funerals are continuing for those who were killed in Friday’s attacks.

The Police Association congratulates the government for demonstrating the courage to take decisive action and ban the firearms that have inflicted so much harm in New Zealand.

The Police Association has issued a statement congratulating the government “for demonstrating the courage to take decisive action and ban the firearms that have inflicted so much harm in New Zealand”.

Association President Chris Cahill says the reforms represent a fine balance between the practical requirements of legitimate firearms users throughout the country, and the need to protect society.

“I hope that the moves immediately attract cross party support because it is important for New Zealanders to know that their political leaders are all on board with this extremely important move,” Mr Cahill said.

Today’s order-in-council immediately moves to Category E class, all Category A semi-automatics that are not shotguns or .22 rifles.

“These are weapons that have been used to slaughter innocent children, women and men while they were at their most vulnerable – at prayer. It is a move we, as a community, can be proud of,” Mr Cahill said.

The Association welcomed the pledge to pass, under urgency in parliament, law that will ban all Category E weapons, including all MSSAs.

“These are significant and bold steps from the government and we applaud them for that. However, they are first steps, and the association looks forward to further reforms which need to follow shortly.”

The next steps need to include a reconsideration of a firearms registry so we do know how many firearms are in our country, and we need a review of the Arms Act.

“The act is dated and needs an overhaul sooner rather than later. Today we have the initial steps, but we should bear in mind that way back in 1997 the key recommendation of the Thorp report was for a full review of the act. We didn’t do it then, but we can make up for that by conducting a full review in the very near future,” Mr Cahill said.

“Today is an extraordinary day that was brought about by dreadful events. This Government has acted swiftly and is sending a message nationally and internationally that the types of weapons and equipment used to enhance the capacity of those weapons to kill many people are not welcome here.”

The Green Party is the next to welcome the government’s announcement on gun control changes.

Green Party co-leader James Shaw said: “Banning military style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles makes everyone safer. Banning these guns is the first step towards systemic changes to our gun laws.

“I welcome this announcement today, we just wish it wasn’t in such tragic circumstances.

“We owe it to the 50 people killed last Friday to ensure this never happens again.”

Leader of the opposition Simon Bridges has released a statement welcoming the changes proposed by the government today to reform our firearms legislation.

“The terrorist attack in Christchurch last week has changed us as a nation.

“National has been clear since this devastating attack that we support changes to our regime and that we will work constructively with the Government.

“We agree that the public doesn’t need access to military style semi-automatic weapons. National supports them being banned along with assault rifles.

“We also support the Government’s proposals to limit the access to other high powered semi-automatic weapons and ammunition.

“We remain committed to ensuring the safety of New Zealanders and fighting extremism in all forms.

“National will work constructively with the Government to ensure we get this right.”

And the press conference has wrapped up.

Bush is now praising the police officers who brought the suspected gunman into custody. He says it took just 20 minutes for them to intervene and bring the man into custody, from when the attack started.

That’s a new number for us, previously we were told it took more than 30 minutes for the arrest to occur, but Jacinda Ardern said yesterday that the time was even shorter than police had previously said.

“I can tell you that every available armed resource responded so quickly to that event and our people acted with absolute courage with in 20 minutes to intervene with that person and bring them into custody.

“It was a very evolving, fast-moving event. That vehicle was identified by the two officers we know of and they acted with absolute courage, in fact, putting the safety of the public before their own to make that happen. I am hugely proud of what they did.”

“The first step is to encourage people to do it voluntarily,” said Bush. “I’m sure that the majority of people will do so. We will then be working with people to ascertain if they haven’t complied and once that period of grace or amnesty goes those people can, and in all likelihood will be prosecuted. So I encourage everyone in that situation so that you don’t become subject to prosecution, to contact us immediately or within the next few days at least.”

Bush warns people that once the amnesty period of three weeks is over, people who are still in possession of their MSSA or assault rifle will be breaking the law and “in all likelihood will be prosecuted”. He warns people to take it seriously and to hand in their firearms.

Bush has been asked about when the two mosques will be able to be opened again.

“We as investigators are working very hard to release those mosques as early as today,” he says. “Not only have we completed our crime scene investigations, but we are working to restore them in a way that is absolutely respectful to those people.”

Bush, once again, urges people not to simply walk into a police station with a firearm without calling ahead first. But again, he says police would prefer people to register their weapon online or via the phone line.

## 179, New Zealand attack: Al Noor mosque imam tells world leaders to fight hate speech

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/22/new-zealand-attack-al-noor-mosque-imam-tells-world-leaders-to-fight-hate-speech

> Imam Gamal Fouda tells thousands that events leading to last week’s massacre ‘did not come overnight’

An imam who survived the terror attack at Al Noor mosque has declared New Zealand “unbreakable” in a sermon attended by thousands in Christchurch on Friday and called on world leaders eliminate hate speech, saying the massacre “did not come overnight”.

Speaking from a temporary stage set up in Hagley Park opposite the mosque, which is still surrounded by police tape a week after the attack, Imam Gamal Fouda said that in attempting to spread hate, the gunman who killed 50 people and injured 42 had instead sparked love and compassion.

“Last Friday I stood in this mosque and saw hatred and rage in the eyes of the terrorist,” he said. “Today from the same place I look out and I see the love and compassion in the eyes of thousands of New Zealanders and human beings from around the globe.”

The service followed a public call to prayer, which was broadcast on national radio and television and followed by a two-minute silence.

Survivors who were injured in the shooting sat in wheelchairs of the front row of the makeshift venue, while at the back, thousands of non-Muslim New Zealanders, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern gathered wearing hijabs to show their respects. Later, Ardern addressed the crowd, saying: “New Zealand mourns with you, we are one.”

Heavily armed police officers stood guard around the outdoor prayer service, while helicopters flew overhead. Under legislation announced by Ardern on Thursday, police will soon be one of the only groups able to access the kind of assault rifles they carry.

Fouda said: “This terrorist tried to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology that has torn the world apart but instead we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable.”

He thanked “the neighbours who opened their doors to save us from the killer” and “those who pulled over their cars to help us”.

He thanked Ardern for “holding our families close and honouring us with a simple scarf”, saying her leadership had been “a lesson for the world”.

Ardern’s gesture of solidarity was echoed by women around around New Zealand, from police officers to council workers, journalists, and the wider public. Some posted images under the hashtags #headscarfforharmony and #ScarvesInSolidarity. The event was supported by the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand and the NZ Muslim Association.

Came across Annelise Zwaan doing puzzles in Christchurch library. “I just think it’s something that is a simple way to show solidarity. I looked a lot at the cultural appropriateness and I felt really reassured by statements from the Muslim community.” #HeadScarfforHarmony pic.twitter.com/MmCYU9EJgL

Fouda also called on the governments of New Zealand and “nearby countries” to tackle hate speech.

“It was the result of the anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim rhetoric by some political leaders, some media agencies, and others,” he said. “Last week’s event is proof and evidence to the entire world that terrorism has no colour, has no race, and has no religion.”

Before the service began, Ardern, wearing the same black headscarf she wore when she met families, said that New Zealand mourned with the Islamic community.

“According to the prophet Muhammad … the believers in their mutual kindness, compassion and sympathy are just like one body,” she said. “When any part of the body suffers, the whole body feels pain. New Zealand mourns with you, we are one.”

Annelise Zwaan was among those who chose to wear a headscarf all day on Friday. “It is one way to share their experiences,” she explained.

Many of those killed in last Friday’s attack have been buried since police completed the formal identification of all bodies on Thursday. Among the 26 being buried on Friday at a single ceremony was three-year-old Mucad Ibrahim, whose sister Luul Ibrahim came from Perth, Australia, to pay her respects.

“My brother, I had never met,” she told The Guardian. “I wish I could have met him, but maybe one day I will meet him in heaven.”

Some people, like Taj Mohammad Kamran, were not able to attend the burial. Kamran was shot in the leg at Al Noor mosque and attended the service in his hospital robe and a wheelchair. He cried as he showed reporters photos of his cousin who was killed in the attack.

Others who were injured in the shooting had to rush back to hospital, their wounds still too fresh to go without constant care.

Mohammed Shahadad was not at the mosque last week. He is chronically ill, and was too sick to attend, but attended on a wheelchair on Friday.

“It was very difficult emotionally to come out today,” he said. “This is my local mosque … It was very moving to look out and see the support that the Muslims have got from the local community and the community all over New Zealand, it’s really pleasing and very emotional.”

## 180, Facebook are 'morally bankrupt liars' says New Zealand's privacy commissioner

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/08/facebook-are-morally-bankrupt-liars-says-new-zealands-privacy-commissioner

> John Edwards calls out social media giant after Christchurch attack for refusing to accept responsibility for harm 

New Zealand’s privacy commissioner has lashed out at social media giant Facebook in the wake of the Christchurch attacks, calling the company “morally bankrupt pathological liars”.

The commissioner used his personal Twitter page to lambast the social network, which has also drawn the ire of prime minister Jacinda Ardern for hosting a livestream of the attacks that left 50 dead, which was then copied and shared all over the internet.

“Facebook cannot be trusted,” wrote John Edwards.

“They are morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide (Myanmar), facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions.

“[They] allow the live streaming of suicides, rapes, and murders, continue to host and publish the mosque attack video, allow advertisers to target ‘Jew haters’ and other hateful market segments, and refuse to accept any responsibility for any content or harm.

“They #dontgiveazuck” wrote Edwards. He later deleted the tweets, saying they had prompted “toxic and misinformed traffic”.

Edwards was responding to an interview given by Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to America’s ABC network, in which he failed to commit to any changes to the Facebook live technology, including a time delay on livestreams.

Zuckerberg said incidents like the live streaming of the Christchurch mosque attacks were the result of “bad actors”; not bad technology and a time delay would disrupt the enjoyment of users who broadcast events like birthday parties or group hangouts.

In a later interview with RNZ on Monday, Edwards described Zuckerberg’s comments as “disingenuous”, and said the company had refused to tell his office how many murders, suicides and sexual assaults had been broadcast using the platform.

“It is a technology which is capable of causing great harm,” Edwards told RNZ.

Before the mosque attacks prime minister Ardern was an avid user of Facebook live, using the technology to broadcast her formal press conferences, as well as more casual, informal messages from the sofa of her Auckland home, or the kitchen of Premier House in Wellington.

The Guardian understands the prime minister’s office were considering what other platforms it could use to broadcast the prime minister’s video messages, including a separate, dedicated website, to avoid using Facebook.

The last Facebook live video posted by the prime minister was a post-cabinet press conference on March 25, and the last informal Facebook live video was a climate change discussion two days before the attack.

On Monday, Ardern said the Royal Commission inquiry into the Christchurch attack will report back to the government by 10 December 10.

The inquiry would look into the suspected gunman’s activities, use of social media and international connections, as well as whether there was “inappropriate” priority setting in state counter terrorism resources, Ardern said in a statement.

> ‘Christchurch Call’ aims to block terror and violent extremism online … student visa scandal ‘bigger than Windrush’ … and Trump state visit backlash

Good morning – it’s Warren Murray with a first taste of the day’s news.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has declared there is no “right to livestream the murder of 50 people” as she spearheads a push to stop it happening again. Ardern and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will host a mid-May summit in Paris calling on governments and tech companies to sign the “Christchurch Call” – a vow to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online.

The Christchurch gunman livestreamed the mosque shootings on Facebook and they were viewed hundreds of times before being taken down. “We want to maintain the principles of a free, open and secure internet, but this isn’t about freedom of expression, this is about preventing violent extremism and terrorism online,” Ardern said. “It’s critical that technology platforms like Facebook are not perverted as a tool for terrorism, and instead become part of a global solution to countering extremism.”

France holds the G7 presidency and will host an upcoming meeting for digital ministers.

‘Bigger than Windrush’ – About 34,000 foreign students have had their visas cancelled or curtailed and more than 1,000 people were forcibly removed from the UK as a result of the English language testing scandal, in which the government sweepingly accused students of cheating on Home Office-approved tests. Others who stayed to clear their names have been told they cannot appeal and must leave the UK. The government cancelled visas after analysis suggested that out of 58,458 tests taken in 96 testing centres, at least 33,725 people cheated. Many of those saying they were wrongly accused have asked to sit a new English test, arguing they are fluent – some are studying for degrees in English literature, accountancy, law degrees and doctorates. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, is expected to rule on the fate of thousands of the targeted students this week.

Trump made to feel unwelcome – Backbenchers are gathering petition signatures to try and have Donald Trump’s state visit cancelled. At the least, angry MPs want to prevent him making an address to parliament marking the D-Day landings. The trip in June was confirmed by Buckingham Palace and the White House on Tuesday. Stephen Doughty, a Labour MP who is gathering signatures, said the invitation was “bonkers” and called Trump a “racist, sexist, extremist” whose presence would deepen divisions in the country. Anti-Trump campaigners have called for a protest in London on 4 June. “It will make lots and lots of people very angry,” said Asad Rehman, from the Stop Trump Coalition.

‘Poorest hit hardest’ by UC – The switch to universal credit will take more than £1,000 a year out of the hands of almost two million people, while 1.6 million will gain by more than £1,000 a year, the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has concluded. The IFS said 11 million adults would lose or gain under the new rules. The research concludes that for many low-income families, losses will fall from more than £1,000 to nearer £100 across eight years. “However, even when measuring people’s incomes over relatively long periods, universal credit still hits the persistently poor the hardest on average,” said Tom Waters, an IFS research economist.

## 182, San Diego shooting suspect posted 'open letter' online

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/28/john-earnest-san-diego-shooting-suspect-posted-open-letter-online

> Antisemitic screed says 19-year-old was motivated by New Zealand mosque massacres and Pittsburgh synagogue shooting
 San Diego synagogue shooting victim died ‘trying to save rabbi’

The 19-year-old California man detained by police after a hate-motivated shooting at a synagogue near San Diego claimed to have been motivated by the deadly attack on two mosques in New Zealand last month.

Police in the US said the gunman, named as John T Earnest, opened fire inside the synagogue in Poway, about 30 kilometres north of San Diego, killing one person and injuring three others including a rabbi.

While no motive for the attack on Saturday has been confirmed, the San Diego county sheriff, William Gore, said investigators were reviewing social media posts and an “open letter” published before the attack.

Posted to online forum 8chan and littered with antisemitic and racist language, the document was similar to one published on the same website by the suspect arrested after the mass shooting inside two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand last month.

The document’s author, who identified himself as John Earnest, claimed to have been motivated by the Christchurch massacre and another shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue in which a white supremacist killed 11 people.

The latter was the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States. The Poway shooting came exactly six months after the Pittsburgh shooting.

Mirroring the New Zealand shooter in format and tone, the document cited biblical verses and white nationalist conspiracy theories while also claiming responsibility for a fire at a mosque in the nearby city of Escondido last month.

Graffiti discovered on the driveway of the mosque following the fire had mentioned the Christchurch attack, and police said on Sunday that Earnest was being investigated in relation to the incident.

The document also referred to a live video stream and linked to a Facebook page, an indication that the author may have tried to broadcast the shooting in the same way as the Christchurch terror suspect.

Gore said the gunman burst into the Chabad of Poway synagogue shortly after 11.20am local time and opened fire with an “AR-style” semi-automatic rifle before fleeing.

There were indications that the gun might have malfunctioned after firing numerous rounds inside the synagogue, the sheriff said.

The San Diego police chief, David Nisleit, said Earnest called 911 shortly after the shooting and surrendered to police. When an officer reached the man on a roadway, “the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody”, Nisleit said.

The attack comes six weeks after a lone gunman shot 50 people dead at two Christchurch mosques. The shooter, who faces 50 charges of murder in New Zealand, was later discovered to have links to the far-right Identitarian movement in Europe.

Following the shooting the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, moved to ban semi-automatic weapons from the country.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/covid-19-how-world-leaders-responded-to-the-crisis

> While Jair Bolsonaro sabotaged quarantine efforts in Brazil, Jacinda Ardern was quietly impressive in New Zealand. Observer writers assess premiers’ reactions to the pandemic
Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus

Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, is one of only a handful of world leaders who have played down Covid-19’s threat, for instance by sabotaging quarantine measures imposed by nearly all of the country’s state governors.

“It’s raining. We’re going to get wet. And some are going to drown in the rain,” the far-right populist shrugged last week, after dismissing the pandemic as a fantasy. That cavalier attitude has sparked nightly pot-banging protests and daily media condemnations. They accuse Bolsonaro – who apparently thinks shutting down the economy will wreck his chances of re-election – of putting his own political future before Brazilian lives.

“Bolsonaro’s reckless behaviour has earned him a position never previously enjoyed by a Brazilian president – that of international villain,” one conservative broadsheet recently declared. Another paper, the Folha de São Paulo, said Brazil needed a Winston Churchill-like statesman to offer “blood, toil, tears and sweat”. Unfortunately, the newspaper lamented, it had nothing of the sort.Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro

While many of her European neighbours were fumbling around for a response, Mette Frederiksen closed her country’s borders on 13 March. A few days later she closed kindergartens, schools and universities and banned gatherings of more than 10 people.

This decisiveness appears to have spared Denmark the worst of the pandemic: its death toll stands at less than 250, and the number of patients being treated in hospital for coronavirus is falling. It has also marked out this skilled and successful politician, who was already the country’s youngest-ever PM, as a once-in-a-generation national leader. A poll at the start of this month found that 79% of Danes thought she was doing a good job, a 40 percentage point rise on the month before.

Her straight-talking speeches and clear instructions to the nation have been widely praised. She has even managed to show a sense of fun, posting a clip on Facebook of herself doing the dishes while singing along to 1980s Danish popsters Dodo and the Dodos during the nation’s weekly TV lockdown singalong.Richard Orange

Donald Trump has benefited from a “rally round the flag effect” which, in a crisis, tends to give US presidents a boost, irrespective of performance.But although 50% of Americans say they approve of his handling of the pandemic, only 37% believe he has shown strong leadership or taken decisive action.And Trump’s approval rating lags some 22 points behind that of state governors and a similar margin behind many other world leaders – cause for concern in an election year.Democrats accuse the president of squandering a crucial six weeks, when he played down the virus instead of preparing for it. Ron Klain, who led Barack Obama’s fight against Ebola in 2014, said: “The US response will be studied for generations as a textbook example of a disastrous, failed effort.”But the president’s allies take the opposite view, praising him for imposing early travel restrictions on China and Europe and overseeing a government effort that included sending hospital ships to New York and Los Angeles. America, as ever, is divided.David Smith in Washington

China’s initial cover-up of the emergence of Covid-19, just when the new disease might have been easiest to contain, overshadows everything it has done since. However, its move to quarantine millions in Wuhan, the centre of the crisis, was bold, unprecedented and ultimately successful in halting the spread of the disease inside China, although at considerable human cost.

The outbreak was a huge threat to Xi’s authority, because of the high economic costs and the inevitable questions about governance prompted by the crisis, and he initially stayed very much in the background of containment efforts. However, once it became clear they were working, Xi has re-emerged to take full credit for the turnaround.

The country’s international propaganda machine is also working overtime to focus on Chinese support for countries in the middle of intense outbreaks, and muddy the waters over the origins of the virus, in a bid to counter rising anger abroad about China’s initial handling of the outbreak.Emma Graham-Harrison

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern is good in a crisis. The mosque attacks in Christchurch, the eruption of Whakaari White Island, and now the Covid-19 crisis, which has brought only four deaths in the country so far, have proved that beyond doubt.

Choosing to “go hard and go early”, Ardern placed the country in total lockdown on 25 March. The decisive move shocked many Kiwis, but Ardern softened the blow using clear, empathetic language and urging everyone to “be kind” to one another – a slogan now emblazoned on billboards around the country. On the first night of the lockdown, she appeared in her tracksuit on Facebook live to reassure the nation.

Epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker says New Zealand’s “elimination” strategy would not have been possible without Ardern at the helm. “The brilliant, decisive and humane leadership of Jacinda Ardern was instrumental in New Zealand’s rapid change in direction with its response to Covid-19, and the remarkably efficient implementation of the elimination strategy.” Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin

Taiwan’s close economic and cultural links with China should have made it extremely vulnerable to Covid-19, but it has one of the most impressive track records on containing the virus. Nearly three months after its first confirmed patient, Taiwan has recorded fewer than 400 cases, and just five deaths; its economy and schools have continued to function largely as normal.

Tsai’s government, helped by the lessons learned during the Sars crisis in 2003 and having Chen Chien-jen, an epidemiologist, as vice-president, took an extremely proactive approach. Screening of travellers from Wuhan began in late December, as soon as China warned of a mysterious new pneumonia.

At a diplomatic level, the crisis has also helped Taiwan highlight Beijing’s heavy-handed approach to excluding it from international bodies, including the World Health Organization. The world health watchdog failed to share an early Taiwanese warning of human-to-human transmission of the new virus, which could have helped global efforts to contain the disease.Emma Graham-Harrison

## 184, Moderate media, a compassionate leader: how New Zealand reacted to a tragedy

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/29/moderate-media-a-compassionate-leader-how-new-zealand-reacted-to-a-tragedy

> Is New Zealand’s civilised response to the Christchurch massacre just down to good stewardship, or is there something else going on?

To the rest of the world, New Zealand’s reaction to the Christchurch massacre has been extraordinary. The killing of 50 people at Friday prayers in two mosques by a white, right-wing Australian has united, rather than divided, this small country and galvanised a parliament that has been prevaricating on gun reform for 30 years into action.

Much of that response has been down to the leadership of Jacinda Ardern. But even there, the public reception has been remarkable.

Decisions that in another political context could have seemed controversial, like wearing a hijab to meet with members of the Christchurch Muslim community who were directly affected by the shooting, and introducing strong gun reform within six days, have been welcomed as respectful and appropriate.

Even those who voted for the opposition have praised Ardern’s leadership. So is New Zealand’s civilised response to a tragedy just down to good stewardship, or is there something else going on?

At a press conference after the shooting, Ardern offered two rallying cries. “This is not us,” in reference to the shooting, and “They are us,” in reference to the Muslim community. Within hours those messages were written on cardboard hearts left at memorials by schoolchildren, plastered across the Twitter profiles of right-wing contrarians (in one case replacing a photo with alt-right figure Jordan Peterson) and adopted almost universally by local media.

As well as a message of unity, Ardern has said that New Zealand needs to examine elements of racism and far-right extremism in its society. She told the Australian television show The Project that she had been “very deliberate” in her language surrounding the attack.

“This was a terrorist attack,” she said. “This was a targeted attack against the Muslim community of New Zealand ... and we as a nation reject violent extremism in all its forms.”

On the streets of Christchurch, questions about Ardern’s leadership are met with: “I’m so proud of her. Aren’t you proud of her?”

Neal Curtis, a senior lecturer in media and communications at the University of Auckland, says the country followed Ardern’s lead.

“Because she was doing stuff practically to change things people could actually mourn and grieve because they knew someone was getting on and doing stuff,” he says. “With the ‘thoughts and prayers’ bullshit in the US, people can’t actually grieve because in the back of their head they are thinking: ‘Oh, I have got to start some kind of protest group to get people to ban guns.’ ”

Attempts by lobby groups to derail the NZ gun reforms have been rebuffed by both sides of politics.

Judith Collins, a member of the conservative New Zealand National party and former police minister, publicly told the NRA to “bugger off”.

Unlike the US, where the gun ownership debate is rights-based, gun laws in New Zealand is a practical issue centred around hunting and farming. There is no justification in that context for assault rifles, and some farmers handed in their firearms before the law changed.

Many New Zealanders, Curtis says, didn’t even know that assault rifles were readily available. For farmers and hunters, Ardern eased the way by not banning the kind of lower calibre and low-capacity semi-automatic firearms they regularly use.

New Zealand media largely heeded the request of police not to use footage of the attack, and instead focused on mourning the victims. The following Friday, journalists and anchors of nightly news bulletins marked the one week anniversary by delivering the news wearing hijabs.

Before the attack, Curtis says, explicit racism and Islamophobia in New Zealand media had been limited to a few conservative columnists and bloggers. Fear-mongering about refugees, particularly Muslim refugees, was not regularly front-page news.

He attributes this in part to the lack of Murdoch-owned press in NZ, and in part to the small size of the Muslim population.

“It is not like the situation in the UK or even in Australia where you have got these regular front pages where people are just bombarded with fear-mongering about immigrants and refugees, and especially Muslims,” Curtis says. “Murdoch, for a start, doesn’t have a significant presence here in terms of newspapers and [he] is the main man behind that in the UK and Australia … so I think the ownership situation is important.”

Racist political rhetoric has in recent years been targeted toward Chinese and southeast Asian populations, including a dogwhistling campaign by Ardern’s party in 2015 around foreign real estate ownership.

But, Curtis says, most New Zealanders also consume a lot of international media and are exposed to the “rampant Islamophobia” of global media as well as soft-balled coverage of right-wing figures. Peterson’s speaking tour last month was sold out. Bookstore Whitcoulls pulled his book from shelves in the days after the attack but had replaced them within 10 days.

Social media also allows easy access to the more extreme white supremacist narratives subscribed to by the alleged gunman. And those narratives, says Curtis, have been tacitly ignored in a country where the racism, like the footwear, is largely casual.

The strength of the unified national response to Christchurch will depend on how those conversations about racism are managed, the political commentator Bryce Edwards says.

“There will be people that react badly to those conversations, and they are hard conversations to have in a sense and they are not always carried out in a productive and constructive way,” he says.

Some of these conversations were already happening. The cumulative impact of a nation where many people are “a little bit racist” was already the focus of a campaign by the Hollywood director Taika Waititi.

Racism is part of the colonial fabric of New Zealand, but it has done more than countries like Australia to reckon with that colonial past and shape itself as bicultural and, increasingly, bilingual. That cross-cultural response was seen in response to the attack.

Māori have made it clear they stand in solidarity with Muslims. Ngāi Tahu, the principal iwi of the South Island, opened its marae (meeting ground) in Christchurch for those wishing to mourn and Māori students led a haka at community vigils.

Edwards says shock over what has occurred, combined with grief and shame and a kind of small-c conservatism that makes New Zealanders “more British than the British”, had “overwhelmed a lot of the politics”.

“New Zealanders were actually quite embarrassed by what happened,” he says. “It’s quite a big challenge to our self-identity.

“We see ourselves as a progressive country and an inclusive one. People do feel a great sense of shame that internationally we might be associated with hatred and racism.”

Kiwis also “don’t talk about politics, religion and sex”, he says.

“But just because we’re not saying it outright doesn’t mean it’s not there.”

 This article was amended on 1 April 2019 to correct a misspelling of the family name of Taika Waititi as Waitiki.

## 186, 'My heart and soul is in grief': Muslims in Christchurch mourn victims of massacre

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/16/my-heart-and-soul-is-in-grief-muslims-in-christchurch-mourn-victims-of-massacre

> In the wake of the worst mass killing in the nation’s history, New Zealanders have rallied around the shocked community

In the silence that wrapped Christchurch after a day of sirens, many struggled to find the language for what had happened to the city.

At a cordon several metres from the mosques where the deadly rampage unfolded on Friday, people came, one by one, to pay their respects. A few shed quiet tears or spoke in hushed tones, but mostly, they just stood and watched.

Mark Isaac was among them. Not allowed into the hospital where his friend from football was fighting for his life, he went to the scene of the massacre instead.

“Unfortunately we are not allowed to visit him in the hospital just yet and now we just have to wait and see what happens to him,” Isaac said. “I feel there’s not much I can do to help but be here and send my love.”

In the wake of the worst mass killing in the nation’s history, which left 49 people dead and 39 injured, New Zealanders rallied around the Muslim community as heartbreaking details continued to emerge about those killed and injured.

Daoud Nabi, a native of Afghanistan and community leader who moved to New Zealand in 1977, was among those killed. His devastated son, Yama al Nabi, told reporters outside of the district court; “He jumped in the firing line to save somebody else’s life and he has passed away”.

Yama al Nabi was running late to meet his father at Al Noor mosque, and arrived to a scene of slaughter. He waited outside, asking about his father. A friend eventually told him “your father saved my life”. His brother, Omar, later confirmed their father had been killed after reviewing footage of the massacre.

Thousands of New Zealanders attended memorial sites and mosques throughout the country on Saturday in support of the friends and family of the dead. Several of those killed were children.

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern travelled to the city to comfort the Muslim community. At the Canterbury Refugee Resettlement and Resources Centre, she told them: “New Zealand is united in its grief and we are united in our grief.”

In Hagley Park, close to Al Noor mosque where 41 people died, a mound of flowers and a sheet full of messages of love grew throughout the day.

Every now and then police would lift the tape blocking off the street to let another hearse through. Nearby, a car had its windows blown out, another reminder of the violence that visited the city the day before. Where the cordon ended, people placed bouquets around a sign that read: “This is Not NZ”.

Others headed for Christchurch hospital in hope of getting news about their loved ones, with dozens of Muslims still listed as missing. Sharifullah Najib, originally from Afghanistan, walked around the grounds of the hospital with a friend. He was supposed to attend Linwood mosque on Friday evening, where the second massacre occurred, but didn’t make it after being called in to work.

“We have come to visit people, we have lost many, many of our friends,” Najib told Guardian Australia. “We are not sure who is alive and who is in the hospital. I have three friends inside. They have bullets in them. Right now we are going to Hagley school where there is a list of the dead bodies.”

But he added: “New Zealanders are supporting us a lot, they love us. They are good people, they are us and we are them”.

For so many in the garden city, the adrenalin of the situation had passed and grief and exhaustion were setting in. Cantabrians are famously staunch, and health authorities at the hospital urged New Zealanders to turn to their friends and families. Radio stations urged people to call counselling hotlines and asked listeners to join them in prayer. For Christchurch residents their resilience is their greatest strength – but it was being sorely tested on Saturday.

As evening came the names of the dead continued to grow. Pakistani man Naeem Rashid. Four year-old Abdullahi Dirie, who was at the mosque with his father and four siblings. His family members survived, but his uncle told the Washington Post the little boy died in hospital. Indonesian-born Lilik Abdul Hamid, who lived in Christchurch. One of Hamid’s relatives wrote on Facebook: “A friend of one struggle... has passed away in New Zealand... the victim of NZ animal terrorist.”

Many remain missing, including a three-year-old who was last seen at Al Noor mosque with his father and brother. The family of a 14-year-old, described as a good-natured, kind teenager with dreams of being an international footballer, were also waiting for news as to his whereabouts. By evening he was confirmed dead. The year-10 Cashmere high school student was in Al Noor mosque for Friday prayers when the attack started.

“I’ve lost my little boy, he’s just turned 14,” his father said. “I haven’t heard officially yet that he’s actually passed but I know he has because he was seen. [I’m] keeping it together and tears are helping. People are helping. Just by being here, it is helping.”

In a statement the Cashmere high principal, Mark Wilson, said: “I know that the Cashmere high school family is grieving”.

“This is an act of terror and hate; we stand in solidarity with our NZ community in condemning this horrendous crime,” he wrote. “Our school had three current students on excused leave from school to attend Friday prayers at the main mosque. We are aware that two of these students are missing, and the other is in hospital with a wound.

“A past pupil of our school was also at the mosque and is also missing. We also understand that there were two fathers of students at our school who were both shot in this incident. We are unable to reveal the identities of these men until advised that is appropriate for us to do so.” Wilson said the best response to such a hateful incident was to show love.

“This can simply mean being kind and caring to each other, be patient, compassionate, and understand everyone will respond differently,” he said.

People struggled to find a place to park at mosques around the country on Saturday morning as New Zealanders turned out in force to show their solidarity.

“Sombre, shocked, but not fearful,” was how a man who attended the Wellington Islamic community mosque in Kilbirnie described the mood. A photo he took of the outside of the building showed messages scrawled inside love hearts in support of Muslims.

“The thing that struck me most was actually the kids,” he told Guardian Australia. “Maybe they don’t understand the full gravity but they were there drawing their hearts out.”

Paying his respects near Al Noor mosque, Egen Isaac said: “My heart and soul is in grief.

“I belong to the Egyptian Coptic orthodox church here in Christchurch and I am originally from Egypt where we had 85 churches burnt to the ground in Cairo several years ago by extremists. So I know what tragedy is, and I am so against any tragedy or any violence in the name of any religion or against any religion.

“I just feel astonished and grieved. This is the first time something like this has happened here and I hope the last time it happens here or anywhere. Unfortunately, one of the people I know who went to this mosque was killed and now I am trying to find out when the burial is so I can support his wife. They are Egyptian like me, and my heart is with them.”

The memorial sites were silent. Some would step forward, placing flowers or a note on the ground. A Salvation Army worker at the scene to support the grieving said it was “just the Christchurch way”.

“I’m from Australia where at times like this people bring out the tea and biscuits and start to chat,” she said. “You have a bit of that here but also, just a lot of people quietly grieving, and so I am here in case they do need to talk or need a shoulder.”

Survivors of the terror attacks were also experiencing severe shock. A 52-year-old father, Adeeb Sami, 52, took a bullet to save his sons at Al Noor mosque. He dived over his sons Abdullah, 29, and Ali, 23, as the gunman burst into the mosque.

“My dad is a real hero,” Adeeb’s daughter, Heba, told Gulf News.

“He got shot in the back near his spine in an attempt to shield my brothers but he didn’t let anything happen to them.” Adeeb was rushed to a hospital where he underwent surgery to extract the bullet.

“I spoke to dad,” Heba said. “He sounded weak and appeared inconsolable. My family survived the attack but many of our friends didn’t.”

Meanwhile, people were still adding to the mounds of cards and flowers around the country, at mosques, in parks and at street intersections, into Saturday evening.

“This is your home and you should have been safe here,” one of the messages said. “Sending your souls love, happiness and peace.”

## 187, Man arrested over violent rightwing extremist threats on social media

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/06/man-arrested-over-violent-rightwing-extremist-threats-on-social-media

> Cormac Rothsey’s arrest follows a NSW joint counter-terrorism investigation with the AFP into rightwing extremism online

A man in Newcastle, New South Wales,has been arrested and charged over threats of violence posted on social media connected to rightwing extremist views.

Cormac Rothsey, a 43-year-old man from Hamilton, near Newcastle in New South Wales, was arrested on Thursday as part of a NSW joint counter-terrorism investigation with the Australian federal police into rightwing extremist ideology online.

“Investigators located a number of concerning posts with rightwing extremist views on social media earlier this week and commenced inquiries,” an AFP spokesperson said.

Police allege that Rothsey, who lived an itinerant lifestyle, was planning a mass casualty attack at a mosque packed for Friday prayer.

In comments made on Facebook he had allegedly expressed admiration for the alleged perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque massacre and made threats to kill the New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern.

“My aim is to go to Friday prayer in a packed mosque,” Rothsey allegedly wrote on Facebook on Wednesday, according to a statement of police facts reported by the Newcastle Herald. “No turning back when called to prayer.”

The Herald reported police had arrested Rothsey after his alleged threats became more explicit on Thursday.

“Australia Cormac Rothsey mosque raid soon,” Rothsey allegedly wrote on Facebook. “Make ya movie. “No turning back.”

At 3.54pm on Thursday, Rothsey allegedly wrote: “Fuckin’ hell. Let’s do it.”

Police allege Rothsey had expressed admiration for the alleged Christchurch shooter, Brenton Tarrant, and made threats against Ardern. When one social media user described Tarrant as a hero. Rothsey allegedly replied that he “should get a free house a medal for bravest aussie since Gallipoli”.

Of Ardern he allegedly wrote: “I want the slut dead... I will use my rifle”.

Rothsey was arrested near Cleary and Beaumont streets in Hamilton at around 5pm on Thursday after threats of violence were allegedly posted. Following his arrest, Rothsey was searched and his mobile phone was seized for forensic examination.

He was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass, or offend and was refused bail ahead of an appearance in the Newcastle local court on Friday.

According to the Newcastle Herald, Rothsey first came to police attention on 27 August 27 after a report to the National Security Hotline about two Facebook profiles espousing anti-Islamic rhetoric.

Police allege that over time his comments on Facebook shifted from posting violent and anti-Islamic content to a stated intent to kill or injure Muslims in a mass casualty attack.

“I will do big damage,” Rothsey reportedly wrote. “I don’t give a fuck about my life.”

Following his arrest police allege Rothsey admitted to making violent and derogatory comments but said he “gets that way” after he drinks alcohol. He told police he did not own any weapons and had not intended on carrying out an attack.

The AFP has urged anyone with information about extremist activity or threats to contact the national security hotline on 1800 123 400.

## 188, New Zealand MPs overwhelmingly back post-Christchurch gun ban

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/10/new-zealand-mps-overwhelmingly-back-post-christchurch-gun-ban

> MPs vote 119-1 to outlaw most semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles

New Zealand’s parliament has voted to ban military-style weapons, less than a month after 50 people were killed and dozens wounded in mass shootings at two mosques in the city of Christchurch.

A bill outlawing most automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and components that modify existing weapons, was passed by a vote of 119 to 1 in the House of Representatives after an accelerated process of debate and public submission.

The bill needs the approval of New Zealand’s governor general, a formality, before becoming law on Friday.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, spoke emotionally during the bill’s final reading, telling of the traumatic injuries to the victims of the attacks on 15 March, whom she had visited in hospital.

“I struggle to recall any single gunshot wounds,” Ardern said. “In every case they spoke of multiple injuries, multiple debilitating injuries that deemed it impossible for them to recover in days, let alone weeks. They will carry disabilities for a lifetime, and that’s before you consider the psychological impact. We are here for them.

“I could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could be obtained legally in this country.”

Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian, has been charged with 50 counts of murder.

Ardern, who has received international praise for her compassion and leadership since the shootings, was able to win rare bipartisan support for the bill, which makes it illegal to own a military-style semi-automatic rifle. The only dissenting voice was from the libertarian ACT party, which has one MP.

The law includes a buyback scheme under which the owners of outlawed weapons can surrender them to police in return for compensation based on the weapon’s age and condition. Anyone who retains such a weapon after the bill passes into law faces a penalty of up to five years in prison. There are some exemptions, including for heirloom weapons held by collectors or for professional pest control.

Ardern said lawmakers had a responsibility to act on behalf of the victims. “We are ultimately here because 50 people died and they do not have a voice,” she said. “We in this house are their voice. Today we can use that voice wisely.

“We are here just 26 days after the most devastating terrorist attacks created the darkest of days in New Zealand’s history We are here as an almost entirely united parliament. There have been very few occasions when I have seen parliament come together in this way and I cannot imagine circumstances where that is more necessary than it is now.”

Ardern said there had been some opposition from firearms owners, but that the response to the proposed legislation had been overwhelmingly positive. “My question here is simple. You either believe that here in New Zealand these weapons have a place or you do not. If you believe, like us, that they do not, you should be able to believe we can move swiftly. An argument about process is an argument to do nothing,” she said.

## 190, New Zealand police investigate threat against Al Noor mosque in Christchurch

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/new-zealand-police-investigating-threat-against-al-noor-mosque-in-christchurch

> Threat was made on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, days before the city marks one year since the massacre that left 51 people dead

Police in New Zealand are investigating a threat against Al Noor mosque a week before the first anniversary of the Christchurch massacre.

Police say they received a report from a member of the public early on Monday morning that a threat had been made against the mosque on encrypted messaging app Telegram, which is known as a platform used by far-right extremists. A photo had also circulated showing a masked man standing outside the mosque in central Christchurch, local media reported.

Worshippers say some in the community have become emboldened since the attacks on 15 March last year at Al Noor and Linwood mosques, which killed 51 people. It remains the country’s worst terror attack in modern history.

Canterbury district commander superintendent John Price told RNZ that police were confident the identity of the person who made the threat would shortly be uncovered, and a rise in threats and activity had been anticipated in the lead-up to the one-year anniversary.

“We have strong leads that we are following up and I am confident we will establish who this person is … we are very close,” said Price.

“It’s the wider context of what this stands for and what ideologies are out there that’s a concern for us.

“No one has the right to cause harm or make threats to other individuals or groups, it’s not the way we do things in New Zealand … I want people to be held to account.”

Price said New Zealanders had been very “motivated” within the last year to report threats against the Muslim community. The country’s threat level for terrorism remained at medium, Price said. Increased patrols had been deployed around both mosques in the lead-up to the anniversary, with police maintaining “a visible presence in the the community”.

Planning was also under way to boost security in the city as the trial date of the man accused of the shootings drew closer on 2 June.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the threat against Al Noor had “devastated” her.

“I will be amongst many New Zealanders who will be devastated to see that as we [head] towards the one-year anniversary of a most horrific terror attack on the Muslim community, that they should then be the target of this kind of activity,” Ardern said.

“That is hard for me to believe and for most New Zealanders they will feel exactly the same way.”

A spokesperson for the Islamic Women’s Council said threats against the Muslim community had ramped up since the attacks, with some in the community appearing to be emboldened.

## 191, New Zealand election: Jacinda Ardern promises stability as she sets poll date

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/new-zealand-election-jacinda-ardern-sets-september-date-for-poll

> Vote on 19 September will also see referendums on legalising euthanasia and recreational marijuana

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced her country’s next general election will be held on 19 September, firing the starting pistol on a campaign race lasting more than seven months.

On Tuesday, Ardern said the forthcoming election campaign would be “positive, factual and robust”, and that her party had signed up to Facebook’s advertising transparency tool to counter misinformation.

“I will be asking New Zealanders to continue to support my leadership and the current direction of the government, which is grounded in stability, a strong economy and progress on the long-term challenges facing New Zealand,” she said.

“We are running an established and effective MMP [mixed member proportional] government, and overseeing a strong economy with low unemployment and growth rates that others look to with envy, outstripping countries we often compare ourselves to, like Australia and the UK while making critical investments in health and education and reducing child poverty.”

Professor Jennifer Curtin, director of Auckland University’s public policy institute said despite Ardern’s best intentions, it would be difficult to keep the forthcoming election clean.

“This will not guarantee the New Zealand voter against negative elements and misinformation, some of which has already begun – there are lessons from the Australian election in this regard, particularly in regards the media’s role in fact checking,” Curtin warned.

Two divisive referendums will also appear on the ballot papers on 19 September. One, on whether to legalise marijuana for recreational use, and another on whether to legalise euthanasia. This could mean higher voter turnout, Curtin said, and research showed “the position of parties, images of the political leaders and their stand on the issue” could influence the referendum results.

Increased turnout might be more likely to benefit smaller parties and possibly Labour as the National party’s demographic base have higher levels of turnout, said Curtin, and more people casting early votes was likely.

After the announcement, Simon Bridges, leader of the opposition National party, said his party had experience leading the country with a stable and competent hand.

“A government I lead will deliver on its promises … when I say I’ll do something, I will do it,” Bridges said. “New Zealanders know we will get things done, whether it’s more money in your pocket, a stronger economy, less tax, building infrastructure and roads or keeping families safer from increasing gang violence.”

“New Zealanders have seen that Labour and Jacinda Ardern can’t deliver. While there’s a lot of announcements, leadership means actually getting things done.”

Bring it on. https://t.co/dKY0K6tXZO

There have long been rumours that Bridges, who is famously unpopular, will be overthrown before the election, with Judith Collins the frontrunner for the role. Collins has a reputation for tough talking and got the nickname “Crusher Collins” in 2009 when she proposed legislation to “crush” the cars of persistent boy racers.

Ardern consistently polls far ahead of Bridges, though her party’s popularity is less dramatic when compared with National.

New Zealand operates under an MMP election system and holds general elections every three years – which many in power say is too short a cycle, and keeps them in constant campaigning mode.

Political scientist Bryce Edwards said that by announcing the election so early, Ardern “receives kudos for her openness, and she appears more confident”.

“The 2020 election campaign appears to be extraordinarily open and unpredictable, things could change dramatically as the campaign progresses,” Edwards said. “Small shifts in the published opinion polls will dramatically alter how people perceive what is happening. And as with previous campaigns – such as when Jacinda Ardern became the Labour leader seven weeks before polling day – we should expect some upsets. It’s likely to be volatile and highly competitive election year.”

There are 120 seats in New Zealand parliament. At the previous election, in 2017, Ardern won the right to govern by forming a coalition with the Green party and New Zealand First.

The 2017 election was one of the most exciting New Zealand had seen, with Ardern taking over as Labour party leader just seven weeks out from polling day, and electrifying the race with ambitious plans to end the housing crisis, reduce child poverty and make the country carbon neutral by 2050.

Ardern’s term in office has seen highs and lows. Although she has been lauded for her empathetic leadership during national tragedies such as the Christchurch mosque shootings and the eruption of Whakaari /White Island, some of her government’s more ambitious plans have not eventuated, most notably, to end the housing crisis.

New Zealand’s indigenous population remains over-represented in poor socio-economic outcomes, and accounts for more than 50% of the prison population, despite representing only 14% of the general population. Ardern’s government has a record number of Māori MPs in its ranks, and Māori are strong Labour supporters, but many Māori leaders say Ardern has under-delivered, and failed to keep her Waitangi promises.

Political observers say Ardern has been forced to roll back her aspirational policies repeatedly due to the kingmaker position held by New Zealand First’s Winston Peters, who is also foreign minister and deputy prime minister.

In April last year, Ardern ruled out introducing a capital gains tax (CGT), a longtime promise of her party, and said one would not be introduced under her leadership because she could not reach a consensus with her coalition partners. A working group appointed by Ardern had recommended such a tax, because New Zealand is one of the few developed countries to not have one.

“While I have believed in a CGT, it’s clear many New Zealanders do not,” Ardern said at the time, in one of the biggest blows of her term.

Peters held the balance of power in the 2017 election, and after a protracted negotiation period threw his support behind Labour, saying he wanted to shake up the status quo. How he will cast his vote this time is much less clear, as there have been evident tensions between Labour and NZ First throughout their leadership experiment.

“For too many New Zealanders capitalism has not been their friend but their foe, ” Peters said at the time, claiming vulnerable New Zealanders had been left behind while the political elite became richer. “We believe capitalism must regain its human face, and that conviction deeply influenced our decision.”

## 192, New Zealand firearm buyback cost could balloon to $300m

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/02/new-zealand-firearm-buyback-cost-could-balloon-to-300m

> Deputy PM says best to ‘prepare for worst’ as MPs prepare to debate gun law changes after Christchurch shooting

The New Zealand government’s planned buyback of semi-automatic firearms in the wake of the Christchurch shooting could cost as much as $300m (£155m), deputy prime minister Winston Peters has said.

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern previously said that the scheme would cost between $100m and $200m, but Peters told Radio NZ on Tuesday it was better to “prepare for the worst”. “It could cost – and this is an extravagant statement but it may well be true – it could cost up to $300m to set what is wrong, right,” he said.

His remarks came as the police minister Stuart Nash introduced proposed changes to parliament on Monday night which MPs will urgently debate on Tuesday. “Owning a fire arm is a privilege not a right in this country,” Nash told MPs.

Proposed measures include a deadline of September for New Zealanders who own soon-to-be illegal firearms to hand them to police.

The government is due to introduce legislation banning most semi-automatic rifles by the end of next week, four weeks to the day since a gunman opened fire in two mosques in Christchurch, killing 50 people.

The laws include up to two years’ imprisonment for selling or possessing a prohibited part, up to five years for possessing a prohibited gun and up to seven years for pointing a prohibited gun at someone.

“The attack exposed considerable weaknesses in our laws. The firearms, magazines and parts used by the terrorist were purchased lawfully and modified into MSSAs [military-style semi-automatic weapons] due to legal loopholes,” Nash said.

He said the misuse of semi-automatic weapons “has left a nationwide legacy of harm, pain and grief”.

After Tuesday, the public will have a week to make submissions on the law before it is put in place by the end of next week.

The proposed bill will ban semi-automatic rifles and military style semi-automatics with the exception of firearms such as .22 calibre rifles and shotguns with magazines that cannot hold more than five rounds of ammunition. It will also ban parts that convert a lower-powered weapon into a higher-powered one, and create a buyback scheme.

Nash said those who rushed to buy weapons when Ardern announced new laws were “foolish”. “If you were foolish enough to buy after the Order in Council had come into force, then you would not be compensated for it,” he said.

Gun City, the Christchurch gun shop that sold the alleged gunman four weapons, said it wanted gun owners to be treated fairly and asked those customers to sign a petition and to slow down the process.

Nash rejected suggestions the government was moving too fast, saying: “Everyone I have spoken to, be they hunters, farmers etc. has said you do not need a military-style semi-automatic or an assault weapon… These are guns that are designed to kill people.”

Peters said next steps included looking at online sales, and a register of guns, by the end of the year.

The Council of Licenced Firearms Owners has said the definitions in the new legislation would make criminals out of 250,000 New Zealanders.

Peters said this was “nonsense”, that gun laws had been “pretty lax”.

At a glance: what we know about the attack 


UK police are stepping up patrols around mosques following the attack, PA reports.

Officers will be deployed to provide reassurance as Muslims attend Friday prayers around the country.

They will also liaise with places of worship about their protective security measures. National policing lead for counter-terrorism Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said:

“Together with our intelligence partners we continually monitor the varied threats we face, including to and around places of worship and specific communities across the country, to ensure we have the most appropriate protective security measures in place to keep people safe.

“Today we will be stepping up reassurance patrols around mosques and increasing engagement with communities of all faith, giving advice on how people and places can protect themselves.”

West Midlands Assistant Chief Constable Matt Ward said officers will be engaging with key religious buildings to reassure local people. He added:

“We will continue to work closely together and unite against those who seek, through violence and extremism, to intimidate or cause fear.

“For us the focus now is the protection of those we serve in the West Midlands. As we are all very aware we face a sustained and determined threat to our security.”

The Muslim Council of Britain called on the Government to redouble efforts to ensure mosques are protected (see earlier).

Mahmood Naseur told TV New Zealand he was forced to hide from the shooter.

We heard the firing and it was from the main entrance of the building, and then everybody just ran toward the back doors, just to save themselves. First we hid behind the cars and under the cars and then we saw the firing was still going on.

We tried to jump the fence, and then we hid in the next house to the mosque. One person we saw was hit with a bullet in her hand and her arm. And when the firing stopped, I just have a look from over the fence, there was one guy changing the gun in the driveway next to the mosque, and he just took the gun and then started firing again.

After that, when the police came, they asked us to come outside, but we stayed there for 10, 15 minutes. We saw many injured and a lady, lying on the road.

Here’s the start of our latest news story:

Forty-nine people have been shot dead and 48 injured in attacks at two mosques during Friday prayers in Christchurch, the worst mass shooting in New Zealand’s history.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said this was “one of New Zealand’s darkest days” as police uncovered explosive devices attached to cars and commissioner Mike Bush urged all mosques across the country to close their doors for the time being.

One explosive had been safely detonated and another was in the process of being dismantled, Bush said, but the situation was still “evolving” with a real possibility of further offenders being explored. New Zealand’s entire police arsenal and personnel were deployed throughout the country and en masse in Christchurch, the South Island’s largest city, which is known to have an active white-supremacist subculture.

Hotels in the inner city stationed security guards at their entrances, and armed police continued to protect landmarks of significance, including the courthouse and Christchurch hospital, which is believed to have been a further target of the suspected terrorist group, with a Christchurch spokesperson telling local media police were concerned the group had plans to target the victims of the mosque attack as they were transported to hospital.

Mohan Ibrahim has told the BBC that he survived the attack on the mosque by climbing out of a window.

The Spanish government has added its voice to the global chorus of condemnation.

“The Spanish government forcefully condemns the terrorist attack committed today against two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch, with the tragic loss of at least 49 lives and the wounding of many more people,” it said in a statement.

“As well as wishing a swift recovery to the injured, the government offers its most sincere condolences to the friends and relatives of the victims , as well as to the people and government of New Zealand, a close ally in the shared fight against extremism and terrorism.”

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said the British High Commission in Wellington is in contact with the New Zealand authorities about the incident.

“British nationals in the area are advised to remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities,” he said. “The British High Commission in Wellington is in contact with the New Zealand authorities and urgently seeking further information.”

It has also updated its travel advice on New Zealand. It says:

There has been a series of shootings in multiple locations in Christchurch. If you are in the area are advised to remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. The British High Commission in Wellington is in contact with the New Zealand authorities and urgently seeking further information. Anyone worried that a British national may have been affected should call the New Zealand Police hotline: (+64) 0800 115 019 from within New Zealand or register with the Restoring Family Links (RFL) website from overseas.

New Zealand police say they are evacuating neighbours of a property in Dunedin linked to the attack.

2/2 Alternative accommodation has been provided for residentsrequiring it and cordons are in place in the Somerville Street and Everton Roadarea.There is no further information available at this time.

Dunedin, is about 350km (220 miles) south of Christchurch.

The Muslim Council of Britain has joined international condemnation of the attack and called for more police protection at UK mosques.

Harun Khan, its secretary general, said:

“This is the most deadly Islamophobic terrorist attack we have experienced in recent times.”

“My condolences to the families affected. As the rest of us prepare to undertake our own Friday prayers today, we do so with the anxiety as to whether our mosques and communities are safe in the face of unabated Islamophobia and hostility against Muslims.

“I call on our government to redouble its efforts to ensure mosques are protected, and call on fellow Muslims to resist the temptation to roll up the banners in fear, as this attack was designed to do.”

Read our weekly election briefing


On the lush green grounds of New Zealand’s oldest university, prime minister Jacinda Ardern is getting mobbed.

Half a dozen police officers clear a path through the heaving crowd in Dunedin, while her security detail tightly flank Ardern, and look increasingly tense as the crowd gets bigger and more demanding.

Her detail are clearly surprised by the intensity of interest, and the crowd’s unwillingness to give up their chance at a brush – literally – with the PM.

Dressed in a maroon coat and bearing her trademark upbeat smile, her diminutive frame is swallowed up by the hundreds of students clamouring for a selfie, a hand-shake or a brief moment of connection.

Scenes of such approval for a political figure are unprecedented in New Zealand. In the year of mayhem that is 2020, Ardern’s ordinariness has become extraordinary; a balm after months of strangeness and change.

“Kia ora, Jacinda; thank you Aunty; hey there my sister!” students yell, as the windows of surrounding buildings open and staff and students lean out as far as they can to watch the hullabaloo. Some, on spotting the PM, ditch their workplaces and run down flights of stairs to join the throng.

@nzlabour lots of lovely spontaneous moments in #Dunedin with Jacinda’s visit. pic.twitter.com/xjhhjUpbGP

Earlier, while announcing a climate change policy viewed in some quarters as somewhat disappointing, the gun-metal grey sky darkened to black, and thick raindrops began to fall. Ardern’s minders moved in with large umbrellas to shield her, but she brushed them aside.

“If you can get wet, I can get wet too!” she shouts at the crowd, who shout back their approval.

“I’m a really big fan of what Jacinda’s been doing in New Zealand, and I just wanted to see her and say thank you,” says Oscar Thomas, 20, a student at the university.

“I feel really inspired by her – she’s cool, calm and collected. She seems genuine. Someone recently called her a celebrity prime minister, but I don’t think it is necessarily a bad thing to idolise someone in that way if they are doing a much better job than everyone else.”

The general election is just one week away, and the Ardern brand is riding high in the polls, routinely clocking in at more than 50% as preferred prime minister.

The Labour party continues to poll 15 points above the opposition National party and is in with a fighting chance of governing alone – a rarity in New Zealand’s mixed-member proportional (MMP) election system, which is designed to install coalition governments.

Labour’s standing has been further boosted by the prime minister’s handling of the coronavirus crisis which, though it has plunged the country into a recession, has earned praise from observers. Other crises during her term include the mosque shootings of March 2018, the Whakaari White Island eruption in December last year.

The opposition leader, Judith Collins, has taken aim at Ardern’s “kindness” theme during the pandemic, saying the prime minister would offer voters only “love and a hug” in the wake of the global pandemic. Collins, meanwhile, would offer them “hope and a job,” she said, pledging a more robust economic response.

The prime minister has promised the strong polling numbers will not make her complacent, and so is dutifully traversing New Zealand on a somewhat contrived campaign trail.

Her demeanour is a marked shift from the 2017 election when she was a virtual unknown. Then, just seven weeks out from polling day, she had to convince Kiwis that at 37, she had the experience and gravitas to lead a country.

Water works on cue pic.twitter.com/4Vy7C7W121

Now, at 40, with multiple disasters, a global pandemic and a toddler under her belt, she has no more convincing to do; and is only required to smile, emote and empathise on cue.

However, there have been some problems – including the abandonment of the KiwiBuild policy to tackle the housing crisis, problematic ministers and accusations her Labour party has repeatedly failed to deliver a clear vision of its Covid-19 recovery strategy.

Businessman Bruce Bernasconi attended Collins’ speech at the Otago Chamber of Commerce in Dunedin the day after Ardern visited. He said he planned to vote for Collins. “All her answers were just so precise, there’s not a lot of waffle,” Bernasconi said. “Jacinda has celebrity status and sometimes she doesn’t stand for anything, you can’t get a straight answer out of her.”

It is this “waffle”, frequently commented on by political analysts following the leaders’ debates, that experts say is dangerous. Given the struggle to convey a post-Covid vision, the Labour party appears to be relying on Ardern’s star power to coast them through to a second term.

“Her brand is really riding high, people feel they have an international hero on Covid and they want to be part of that,” says Jennifer Lees-Marshment, an expert in political communication from Auckland university.

“It’s concerning when expectations get this high because you are always bound to disappoint. No leader is going to have an easy ride for the next year in New Zealand. And she still hasn’t articulated a clear vision, nor any clear policy agendas. It’s not clear what they’ve done and what they’re still planning to do.”

“She’s not trying to win a mandate, she’s not trying to win anyone over, so while this appears safe for Labour, it’s actually a very dangerous strategy.”

Ardern’s popularity with children and young people cannot be overstated. The prime minister has long stated that she entered politics to improve the lives of children, and her commitment to end child poverty has become the defining promise of her political career.

They gravitate towards the PM, and she makes time for each child, asking how the school holidays are and what subjects they enjoy. The warmth and likability that draw children in and make them feel at ease also seems to work with older voters.

“It’s pretty special what Jacinda is able to do; she really blends that leadership quality you need with being relatable, kind and down to earth. She’s relatable for common people,” says Tohunga Riwai, 21, a politics major.

“She’s not perfect, no leader is, but given a few more years to govern, I think she can really keep the progress of New Zealand up.”

Back in Dunedin, eating cheese rolls is a fixture of the New Zealand campaign trail, and come morning tea the Labour hikoi crowd into Hungry Hobbos on George street; ordering a dozen of the southern snacks.

Heading for the exit, one of Ardern’s press secretaries calls out loudly: “Did we pay?” as dozens of red-clad fans squeeze out of the door, letting in a blast of cold air.

Ardern throws up her hand, and shouts: “I paid!” before heading out into the grey streets, where her people are waiting in the rain.

## 196, Christchurch attack: Prince William meets five-year-old survivor

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/christchurch-attack-prince-william-meets-five-year-old-survivor

> William tells crowd at Al Noor mosque that New Zealand’s response to shootings set an example

Prince William has delighted a young survivor of the mosque shootings by visiting her in hospital in Auckland.

Alen Alsati, 5, sustained numerous critical injuries in the Christchurch attacks in which 50 people were killed on 15 March. Alsati cannot see, walk, or move properly. She also suffered brain damage, her doctors said, and it is not yet known if it will be permanent.

She has been treated at Starship hospital in Auckland and woke from a coma this week.

William perched on the edge of her bed as she confidently asked him questions. Alen only began talking again – in English and Arabic – a few days ago. New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was also at the child’s bedside, wearing a bronze-coloured hijab.

“Do you have a daughter?” Alsati asked William.

“Yeah, she’s called Charlotte,” he replied.

“What’s the name called?”

“Charlotte. She’s about the same age as you.”

“Charlotte,” Alsati murmured quietly.

The Duke of Cambridge is on a two-day tour of New Zealand to pay his respects to the survivors of the shootings, in which dozens were shot dead by a lone gunman. Details of William’s visit have been kept tightly under wraps, due to the country’s heightened terror risk.

On Friday, Ardern and the Duke also visited a Christchurch hospital where some survivors were still recovering, before visiting Al Noor and Linwood mosques, where William told those assembled that love had triumphed over hate in awful circumstances.

He began his speech in te reo Māori – just as his brother Prince Harry and wife Megan did when they visited New Zealand – as well as in Arabic, greeting the crowd with as-salaam alaikum [peace be upon you].

The lone gunman in the attack had sought to sow division, but William said: “I’m here to help you show the world that he failed.”

“An act of unspeakable hate had unfolded in New Zealand – a country of peace,” he said. “In a moment of acute pain you stood up, and you stood together. And in reaction to tragedy you achieved something remarkable … an act of violence was designed to change New Zealand. But instead the grief of a nation revealed just how deep your wells of empathy, compassion, warmth, and love truly run.

“You showed the way we must respond to hate – with love.”

Footage posted by Kensington Palace showed the Duke swamped by people at Al Noor mosque, and chatting animatedly.

Emergency responders who met William said he showed keen insight and compassion regarding their work, because of his work as a rescue helicopter pilot. “You did an incredible job on a very bad day,” William told ambulance workers.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/21/explainer-how-are-new-zealands-gun-laws-changing

> A quick guide to the gun reforms announced by prime minister Jacinda Ardern

The following is the text of the statement from the New Zealand government on what the changes to the country’s gun laws will mean:

1. What semi-automatic firearms will be affected by the ban?

The ban will apply to all firearms that are now defined as military-style semi-automatics (MSSAs) and will also include assault rifles.

2. What semi-automatic firearms will not be affected by the ban?

There is a balance to be struck between public safety and legitimate use. The changes exclude two general classes of firearms which are commonly used for hunting, pest control, stock management on farms, and duck shooting.

Semi-automatic .22 calibre rimfire firearms with a magazine which holds no more than 10 rounds

Semi-automatic and pump action shotguns with a non-detachable tubular magazine which holds no more than five rounds

3. What semi-automatic firearms are affected by today’s changes?

Two types of firearms are now defined as MSSAs:

A semi-automatic firearm capable of being used with a detachable magazine which holds more than five cartridges

A semi-automatic shotgun capable of being used with a detachable magazine which holds more than five cartridges

4. What happens to people who have A-Category firearms licences and now, after the changes, own MSSAs?

It would normally be an offence for an A-Category licence holder to possess an MSSA, punishable by up to three years in prison or a $4,000 fine. However a transitional period gives time for people to comply with the law, if they take certain steps. The transitional period will be confirmed next month. Firearms owners who unlawfully possess an MSSA now have three options

Voluntarily surrender the firearm to police for safe disposal

Complete an online form on the police website to arrange for the MSSA to be collected, while details are finalised for compensation under a buy back scheme

Sell or gift the firearm to a person who has an E-Category licence and a “permit to procure” the weapon

5. Are the police geared up to receive large numbers of MSSAs?

Yes. They will work with the the New Zealand defence force to enable safe storage, transport and destruction of MSSAs. Police are establishing an online form which will make it easier for firearms owners to arrange for Police to collect the MSSAs. The online form will go live over the weekend. It will not be practicable for firearms owners to physically return their weapons to police stations without prior approval. Where extra administrative staff are required they will be hired on fixed-term contracts.

6. Will this lead to stockpiling of semi-automatics?

No. The changes take effect immediately. Anyone who now unlawfully has an MSSA, which yesterday was a lawful firearm, needs to take steps to comply with the law.

7. Will some firearms dealers be breaking the law if they have these MSSAs in stock?

Some firearms dealers only hold A-category licences. In order to comply with the law, they could sell their stock of semi-automatics to a Category-E licence holder or return them to their supplier.

8. What are the statistics for firearms licences and firearms in circulation in New Zealand?

There are 245,000 firearms licences

Of these, 7,500 are E-Category licences and 485 are dealer licences

There are 13,500 firearms which require the owner to have an E-Category licence, this is effectively the known number of MSSAs before today’s changes

The total number of firearms in New Zealand is estimated to be 1.2-1.5m

9. What further issues are being considered?

Cabinet will consider further steps on 25 March. These will include measures to:

Tighten firearms licensing and penalties

Impose greater controls over a range of ammunition

Address a number of other issues relevant to special interest groups such as international sports shooters and professional pest controllers, such as DoC.

Futureproof the Arms Act to ensure it is able to respond to developments in technology and society

10. How will the buyback work, and who will administer it?

Police, the Treasury and other agencies are working through the detail. More information will be available when the legislation is introduced next month. The compensation will be fair and reasonable based on firearm type, average prices and the age of firearms.

11. What is the cost of the buyback likely to be?

That is very difficult to judge, given the limited information about the total number of firearms affected by this change. Preliminary advice suggests it could be in the range of $100m-$200m. The buyback will ensure these weapons are taken out of circulation and that we fulfil our obligations under the law.

## 200, More NSW voters want tighter gun laws in wake of Christchurch shooting

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/22/more-nsw-voters-want-tighter-gun-laws-in-wake-of-christchurch-shooting

> New polling shows support for stricter gun control, as Shooters hope for balance of power after NSW election

New polling suggests a rise in the number of voters who believe Australia’s gun laws need tightening in the wake of the Christchurch terrorist attack.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced sweeping and immediate changes to the country’s gun laws on Thursday, including a ban on firearms used in the deadly Christchurch shooting and the introduction of a buyback scheme.

The ban includes “military style semi-automatic” rifles and shotguns capable of being used with a detachable magazine holding more than five cartridges.

The reforms bring New Zealand closer into line with Australia, often held up as an international benchmark for gun policy since former prime minister John Howard reshaped the laws in the wake of the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania.

But on the eve of the state election in New South Wales, which could deliver the balance of power to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party, polling suggests many believe Australia’s laws need strengthening.

An Essential poll of 550 voters in Sydney carried out immediately following the Christchurch attack found that 37% of respondents thought Australia’s gun laws were too weak, a jump from 26% in 2018.

The proportion of people who thought Australia’s firearm laws were “about right” fell from 64% to 52%.

The figures will be used by gun control advocates concerned the category system put in place in the national firearms agreement in 1996 has not been updated to keep pace with rapidly changing technology.

A new fast-lever action rifle, the Speedline, from the French manufacturer Verney-Carron, has been available for purchase in Australia as a category B firearm since 2017. The gun lobby has pushed for legalisation of imports of Adler lever-action shotguns and a second Verney-Carron gun, the Veloce shotgun, which has a fast fire and reload mechanism.

Former justice minister Michael Keenan was subjected to intense face-to-face lobbying from gun advocates during a review of the national firearms agreement, and the well-resourced Australian gun lobby groups have increasingly flexed their muscle at recent elections.

At the 2017 Queensland state election, gun groups pumped more than $500,000 into helping minor political parties win seats and were active in campaigning during the Victorian state election, launching an advertising blitz about crime rates under the Andrews Labor government.

In NSW, the increased likelihood of right-wing minor parties – including the Shooters – holding the balance of power after Saturday’s election has turned the state’s attention to attempts to alter gun laws.

The Coalition has criticised Labor for directing preferences to the Shooters, which the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, on Friday called a “fringe” party whose policies were “unacceptable”.

The opposition leader, Michael Daley, has said he would “resign” from the parliament if the state’s gun laws were weakened.

But the government hasn’t always been so reluctant to discuss changes to gun laws.

In November 2017 the now deputy premier, John Barilaro, was accused of seeking to foster “an American-style guns culture” after he called for an inquiry into the state’s Firearms Act “in relation to persons who believe they are reasonably and proportionately responding to a threat imposed on themselves of their family”.

Samantha Lee from Gun Control Australia has called for both parties to rule out any changes.

“Voters deserve confidence that the temptation of a parliamentary deal with the Shooters won’t result in a weakening of our gun laws,” she said.

“Both major parties must give voters confidence that they won’t be tempted by backroom deals with pro-gun advocates.”

University of Sydney associate professor Philip Alpers, who founded a website that tracks gun policy country by country, said New Zealand’s announcement had brought it much closer to the Australian model of gun control.

“Australia has the most comprehensive and most likely-to-succeed suite of gun laws in the world, and New Zealand has almost reached that same level,” he told Guardian Australia.

“It’s a very bold move and has a very good chance of having the same public health benefit as the Australian gun laws.”

In 1996 Howard worked with states and territories to establish the national firearms agreement, which banned rapid-fire guns from civilian ownership except under restricted licences.

He also established a government buyback of semi-automatic and pump-action rifles and shotguns.

The laws reduced firearm numbers in Australia by about one-fifth, with more than 700,000 guns removed and destroyed. Studies have suggested the agreement had an impact on firearm-related deaths in Australia.

Alpers said he believed Ardern faced an easier task in changing New Zealand laws. New Zealand is a single jurisdiction with a unicameral parliament, while Howard’s agreement required the support of every Australian state and territory government as well as the Senate.

But, he said, the lack of a firearms registry meant New Zealand authorities might have little idea where guns were.

“A gun that they know left a dealer 15 years ago may have changed hands 20 times, so they have no idea because they haven’t kept a record,” he said.

He said there would be no easy way for gun manufacturers to adapt their weapons under NZ’s proposed laws because the wording of the buyback scheme was broad.

In the United States, state legislation often names specific models to be banned. Manufacturers can slightly tweak weapons and call them something different, thus finding a loophole.

“They [New Zealand] don’t fall into the dreadful trap the Americans fell into,” Alpers said. “In some cynical cases [manufacturers] would call the AD16 an AB16, which stood for after ban.”

Alpers said New Zealand’s laws now brought them into the “mainstream of gun control around the world”.

“Europe and Asian countries in many cases had tougher gun laws than New Zealand, that was almost exclusively because of the lack of registration,” he said.

Japan has very few guns, China’s are state controlled, Singapore has the death penalty for illegal ownership of firearms and Thailand is awash with guns but has strong laws, Alpers said.

New Zealand, the US and to some degree Canada are the only countries without a universal registration system.

“Registration is a pillar of gun control and has been in 150 countries for a century and a half,” he said.

“The first pillar is licensing … then you register the object ... and then you make it clear that ownership of a firearm is a conditional privilege, which can be taken away.”

He said all three pillars were absent in the US, in NZ two pillars existed – strong licensing and a definite rejection of the right to bear arms.

“The middle pillar, the third leg on the stool if you like – registration – simply doesn’t exist in New Zealand … so like a two legged stool it’s an unreliable object.”

## 201, The 'internet SS': how the Halle murders follow a template established in Christchurch

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/15/the-internet-ss-how-the-halle-murders-follow-a-template-established-in-christchurch

> It’s important to grasp just what these men mouthing online injokes as they commit murder are trying to achieve

At one point during the video feed he streamed on Twitch, the gunman who killed two people outside a synagogue in Halle in Germany smirks to the camera, “nobody expects the internet SS”.

Increasingly, we should.

The Halle murders follow a familiar template of violence, one established by the massacre of 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand in March this year, and then repeatedly imitated by fascists since.

In April, a young man shot up a synagogue in Poway. Beforehand, he published a manifesto hailing the 8chan bulletin board and then tried to livestream his violence.

In August, another fascist murdered 22 people in a racist attack on a Walmart in Texas. He, too, posted a document on 8chan praising the NZ massacre and its perpetrator.

The latest killer begins his Twitch stream with the now customary shout out to the anonymity of chan culture.

“My name is Anon and I think the Holocaust never happened,” he says.

To understand the “internet SS” – these men mouthing online injokes as they commit murder – it’s important to grasp just what such killers seek to achieve.

They see individual terrorism as a method for channelling into action the remarkable support that fascists enjoy on the darker recesses of the internet.

The architects of this strategy know that the sullen, unhappy young men attracted to 8chan already obsessed over the ever more frequent school shootings and workplace massacres in America, imagining them as moments of transformation in which a sad loser becomes, even for a few instants, an avenging god, his diminished potency and status miraculously redeemed by the weapon with which he mows down his enemies.

For ideologically-committed fascists, it makes sense to harness the dark allure of gun massacres for political ends.

Genuine fascism distinguishes itself from rightwing populism not so much by ideas but by action – in particular, by a commitment to violence, intended both to eliminate enemies and to restore the mystical soul of the nation.

But, in the United States, the attempt to build a fascist movement collapsed after the murder of Heather Heyer at the Unite the Right event in Charlottesville.

The Australian fascist grouplets fared little better.

So instead of trying to organise further rallies, another option was to follow the script established by apolitical rage killers: stockpiling weapons, writing a list of grievances and meticulously planning a final confrontation. But at every step, the apolitical complaints of the school shooter could be replaced with the rhetoric of classical fascism.

That meant choosing symbolic targets, adorning guns with slogans, and writing political manifestos. In particular, it meant ensuring fascists on 8chan and elsewhere knew they were being addressed directly, by the use of their favourite memes and through livestream video over which they could exult.

If racial murder were gamified murder, terrorism itself could become a meme, a concept that would replicate and spread online, so that fascist gun massacres became a constant temptation for the damaged young men already committed to far-right ideas.

The Halle events reveal something of how that might work.

Even in the very different conditions prevailing in Germany, the perpetrator followed the model established in English-speaking countries.

He, too, wrote a manifesto, in which he set himself game-like targets to achieve (“Kill a Muslim and a Jew”, “kill someone with a pipe bomb”). He, too, streamed the violence, in footage in which he, perhaps inadvertently, revealed the pathetic desperation underlying the chan milieu.

“I killed a couple, I tried,” he mutters at one point. “Then I die. As the loser that I am.”

As news of the murders broke, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sent his condolences, describing the attack carried out on Yom Kippur as “another expression of rising anti-Semitism in Europe”.

He’s right, of course.

But the murderer’s casual shift from attacking a synagogue to executing a crying man in a kebab shop shows, once again, how antisemitism and Islamophobia reinforce each other.

The contemporary Jew-baiter and the modern Islamophobe make almost identical assertions: the Jew/Muslim wears strange clothes, eats distinctive foods, fosters violence and transforms the culture. More importantly, when bigots warn against an Islamic plot to transform the continent into “Eurabia”, they popularise a conspiracism akin to the old libel about the Elders of Zion secretly running the world.

The methodology matters more than particular details.

If you think the Holocaust never happened, you might equally believe in a Muslim Brotherhood plan to introduce sharia by stealth, probably perpetuated with the assistance of Cultural Marxists.

An attack on mosques, we’ve now seen, can inspire murder in a synagogue – and, for that matter, the killing of Mexican immigrants in El Paso.

That’s surely one lesson from the Halle murders: the normalisation of racial populism must end. When politicians – and Netanyahu’s a particularly notorious example – embrace xenophobia and Islamophobia, they facilitate a hatred that will be vented on the bodies of all kinds of scapegoats.

If ever there was a time for Jews and Muslims to unite, it’s now.

But we also need to think about the “internet SS”.

For obvious historical reasons, fascism in Europe looks very different from the tiny grouplets active in Australia and the US.

The far right in Germany boasts electoral successes as yet unimaginable in the English-speaking world. Nonetheless, the creation of a mass fascist movement still depends on a normalisation of political violence, something that, as yet, hasn’t taken place.

The misfits embarking on racial murder sprees to the cheers of their online pals will not create a fascist revolution. They might, however, reinforce an association between far-right ideas and actual violence, opening up the fissures between racial populism and genuine fascism in a way that encourages a move from one to another.

That, at least, is what the killers hope.

On the sites on which fascists gather, the Halle murderer has not, so far, received the acclaim he sought. The anons have mocked his appearance and his ineptitude, with many – in the usual logic of conspiracists – dismissing his actions as a so-called “false flag”.

Even so, again and again, the discussions come back to the single question: how might he have done better?

The implications are obvious – and terrifying.

## 202, Facebook removed 1.5m videos of New Zealand terror attack in first 24 hours

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/17/facebook-removed-15m-videos-new-zealand-terror-attack

> Site says it will remove any clip featuring gunman’s footage even if that would not normally break its rules

Facebook removed 1.5m copies of the video of the New Zealand terrorist attack in the first 24 hours after Friday’s shootings, highlighting the enormous challenge involved in keeping violent and offensive material off social networks.

Fifty people died in the attack on two mosques in Christchurch, which was livestreamed for 17 minutes on Facebook by the gunman. Although the original footage was removed after an hour and banned by the most popular social media sites, it has since been repeatedly reuploaded by other users, leaving tech companies struggling to keep it off their servers.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said she will seek talks with Facebook on its efforts to stop circulation of the video. The social network’s livestreaming system was rolled out to all users as Facebook Live in 2016 and has increasingly become known for a series of murders and suicides broadcast on the system.

“This is an issue that goes well beyond New Zealand but that doesn’t mean we can’t play an active role in seeing it resolved,” said Ardern. “This is an issue I will look to be discussing directly with Facebook.”

The comments came as politicians in the UK said social media companies had to step up efforts to tackle online hate. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “The big media companies certainly have to do more. As the world becomes more and more digital, we have to find ways of ensuring our digital environment is regulated as effectively, and behaves with the same standards and norms, that we would expect in the real world around us. That clearly isn’t happening at the moment.”

Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “We’ve got to be far more aware of the dangers of the far right.” He agreed with calls by his deputy, Tom Watson, for social media firms to do more to tackle the problem. He said they should act immediately to remove content such as the videos uploaded by the alleged attacker in the Christchurch shootings, but said it also raised the question of regulation.

Social networking companies, which have built enormously profitable businesses by designing sites that make it simple for anyone to upload and distribute material, are now fighting their own systems as they try to keep the video off their sites.

In the first day after the attack, Facebook says it blocked 1.2m attempts to upload the video thanks to its system automatically recognising the footage and a further 300,000 clips were removed by moderators after going live.

The social network said it was removing any clip featuring the gunman’s footage, even if that would not normally break its rules. “Out of respect for the people affected by this tragedy and the concerns of local authorities, we’re also removing all edited versions of the video that do not show graphic content,” said Mia Garlick of Facebook New Zealand.

This goes further than several British news organisations such as MailOnline, the Sun and the Mirror, which faced an outcry on Facebook after uploading edited versions of the gunman’s footage to their websites on Friday morning. Mail Online also uploaded a full copy of the gunman’s 74-page manifesto, which was later removed.

Despite this, the Sun and the Daily Mail’s print editions used their Saturday front pages to attack social networks for hosting the video. The Daily Mail front page article headlined “Massacre shame of Facebook” criticised the social network for enabling “sick users to copy the footage and repost it across the web”, without mentioning that its sister website had uploaded parts of the footage and the shooter’s manifesto.

YouTube has also taken measures to remove video of the attack from its site, although for some time it was easy to find the footage by entering simple search terms relating to the attack.

Although it is relatively simple for social networks to block identical uploads of the same video, users have bypassed these blocks by editing footage of the attack or by simply filming the original video on their laptop screen.

While mainstream social networks have been criticised for their role in hosting the footage, many more copies are likely to have spread via encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp and Telegram.

## 204, NZ election weekly briefing: leaders' final debate; Monty Python tax row; Greens get a boost

> Final TV clash goes to Ardern, PM at pains to rule out capital gains; Collins no fan of choc wheatens at the negotiating table

Read our weekly election briefings here


Kia ora koutou.

The final leaders debate went Jacinda Ardern’s way on Thursday night, with Judith Collins subdued after a difficult week on the campaign trail, writes Eleanor Ainge Roy.

Asked whether her government had been “transformational”, Ardern said it had but that she needed more time to repair decades of neglect in housing, transport and the environment. Both Ardern and Collins said they would commit to halving child poverty by 2030.

The rivals were then asked if they had anything to say to each other. Ardern thanked Collins for her “moving and sincere” speech after the Christchurch mosque shootings in March last year, and her action on gun control.

Collins thanked Ardern for giving “her heart and soul” to the job of prime minister, and said she knew the effort, time and toll it could take. Collins admitted that while she enjoyed the campaign trail, she missed having dinner with her husband and son.

With more than 1.4m advance votes already cast, both National and Labour have switched from winning hearts and minds to simply boosting turnout ahead of election day on Saturday (though National did sneak in one more policy announcement: a commissioner for senior citizens).

You may have heard – Ardern has ruled out, for the nth time, a wealth tax under a Labour government. “I won’t allow it to happen as prime minister,” she said while campaigning in Christchurch on Wednesday.

Ardern has been forced to repeatedly deny the possibility of the Greens’ desired tax of 1% on net wealth over $1m (and 2% over $2m) this week as Collins insisted she would change her mind in coalition.

Stuff’s Thomas Coughlan likened the “absurd” discourse to Monty Python’s dead parrot sketch, “with one politician asserting the tax dead, deceased or passed on, while another claims it is very much alive”.

Ardern has not wavered from her position, and says National forcing the point speaks to their “desperation and misinformation” in the final leg of the campaign.

The least that can be said for the approach is that it distracts from Collins’ description of obesity as a “personal choice” – the other way she has grabbed headlines this week. It was perhaps to pander to the food lobby, suggests Anna Rawhiti-Connell for Radio New Zealand.

Even Collins’ own MP, Mark Mitchell (a likely contender for National’s leadership, should Collins lose the election), was quick to agree that obesity was “more complex” an issue than could be solved by personal responsibility and frozen veg.

Collins’ fixation on the wealth tax suggests she has picked Labour’s most likely path to government as a coalition partner with the Greens. That party is refusing to let the dream die, with co-leaders Marama Davidson and James Shaw emphatic that it remains on the table until after the election.

But it is possible that Labour may be able to govern alone – dampening hopes for a more progressive coalition (because, again, just to be clear: Ardern has said “now is not the time to be experimenting with tax policy”).

Labour has pushed its past successes and the importance of continuity this campaign – an approach that has been decried by some supporters as, at best, risk-averse.

Experts polled by Charlotte Graham-McLay gave Ardern’s government a C or C+ grade for its performance on the environment and poverty, while the BBC’s Shaimaa Khalil spoke to those who feel let down by her leadership.

This week finance minister Grant Robertson gave credence to criticisms of centrism by appealing directly to supporters of former National leaders John Key and Bill English in a new television spot. The Spinoff’s Toby Manhire also contrasted the Nats’ past campaign messages with those of Labour in 2020 in a quiz and found them surprisingly hard to distinguish.

In The Conversation, Massey’s Richard Shaw writes that the “Jacindamania” of 2017, promising transformation, has been replaced by “rhetoric of recovery”. Those looking for greater action on climate, in particular, will have their fingers crossed for a strong showing from the Greens on Saturday. Politik’s Richard Harman has considered how a relationship might work, as has RNZ’s Tim Watkin.

As Eleanor Ainge Roy writes in two explainers, on New Zealand’s Mixed Member Proportional system and its history of coalition governments, Ardern’s policy has been not to comment on coalition negotiations – though polling suggests voters would prefer it were made clear before the election.

RNZ’s Peter Wilson says all signs point to a four-party Parliament. Act’s David Seymour has had the strongest campaign of the minor parties, capitalising on the lacklustre performance by New Zealand First and National.

With Winston Peters’ kingmaker days behind him, Newsroom’s Sam Sachdeva has explored options for who Ardern might choose as her deputy PM. The Spinoff’s Alex Braae has also shared his predictions for the minor parties.

Fringe party Advance NZ has had its Facebook page shut down because of “repeated violations” involving the spreading of misinformation about Covid. Party co-leader Billy Te Kahika called it “a cynical example of election interference”.

The latest 1 NEWS Colmar Brunton Poll, published on Thursday, held good news for the Green party, with a two-percentage point rise to 8%, while both Labour and National dropped a point to sit on 46% and 31% respectively. That scenario would mean Labour would need a coalition. In terms of preferred PM, Ardern rose 5% to 55%, while Collins dropped 3% to 20%.

Internal Green polling on the cannabis referendum provided to the Spinoff suggests the result will go to the wire, with advance voters less likely to be in favour. Some early voters may not have appreciated the New Zealand Medical Association suddenly changing its stance from opposed to neutral. A Research New Zealand poll put 46% in favour and 40% against.

Sunday’s Te Ao News/Curia poll puts the Māori party co-leader John Tamihere at 29% in Tāmaki Makaurau, behind Labour’s Peeni Henare on 35% – perhaps the best shot for the party’s survival, writes Leigh-Marama McLachlan for the Guardian.

Advance and overseas voting ends on Friday (here’s our o/s voting guide). It is also the last day to enrol to vote (except in-person at polling places on election day).

Voting is open 9am to 7pm on Saturday. Preliminary election results will be released progressively after 7pm. Preliminary referendum results are not expected until the end of the month.

I’m not someone who takes chocolate biscuits to the bargaining table.

Collins’ sights remain set on leading outright with an apparent swipe at Ardern’s peace offering of gingernuts and chocolate wheatens at coalition talks in 2017 (frozen veg, then?). Asked for her strategy for the last days of the campaign, Collins said it was to “basically be far more fabulous than anything on the other side”. Graham-McLay interrogated her polarising style in this Guardian profile.

“I love the smell of election hand sanitizer in the morning....The smell, you know that alcohol smell. Smelled like victory.” pic.twitter.com/XatuH33TOC

While the loss of “I voted” stickers was mourned last week as a Covid-related casualty, the hand sanitiser on offer at polling stations has proved a bright spot with the fragrance widely praised on social media as “absolutely delightful”.

Peter Riordan, the Electoral Commission spokesman, told the Guardian that the Earthwise Nourish sanitiser was selected for its price and the fact that it was New Zealand-made: “The pleasant fragrant was an unexpected bonus.” (To be clear, this is not #sponcon.)

Thursday’s night’s most heated debate moment came when Collins accused Ardern’s government of repeatedly breaking promises to voters. Ardern responded that she was not a liar and objected to being labelled one, slamming Collins for causing “mischief” and spreading “misinformation”.

We’ll be back with one post-election wrap, early next week. Thanks for reading.

## 206, World’s first openly transgender MP, Georgina Beyer, dies in New Zealand aged 65

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/06/worlds-first-openly-transgender-mp-georgina-beyer-dies-in-new-zealand-aged-65

> The former actor, drag performer, sex worker and radio host pulled off a surprise victory as a Labour MP and later played a pivotal role in decriminalising prostitution

Former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark has led tributes to Georgina Beyer, the world’s first openly transgender MP, who has died.

Friends announced “with the heaviest of hearts” on Facebook on Monday that the 65-year-old had died at a Wellington hospice.

“Georgie was surround by her nearest and dearest 24/7 over the past week, she accepted what was happening, was cracking jokes and had a twinkle in her eye, right until the final moment,” Scotty Kennedy wrote.

“Farewell Georgie, your love, compassion and all that you have done for the Rainbow and many other communities will live on for ever.”

Beyer, a former actor, drag performer, sex worker and radio host, was born in Wellington but moved to Australia as a young adult.

After moving back to New Zealand, she grew interested in a political career and in 1995, won the mayoralty in Carterton, a town 80 kilometres northeast of Wellington that served as a farming hub.

“It’s less of a reflection on me but a wonderful reflection on them – rural conservative New Zealand. Who would have thought?” she told the NZ Herald in a 2018 interview.

Drafted to run for parliament for the Labour party, Bayer pulled off an upset victory as Clark’s government took office.

The former prime minister said Beyer “showed tremendous courage” stepping into public life and “the public warmed to her honesty”.

“Her election speaks volumes about both Georgina’s personal skills and dedication to community service and the district’s willingness to accept her on her merits without discrimination,” she said.

In parliament, Beyer wasted no time displaying her now-legendary wit, drawing laughs from all sides of the house in her maiden speech.

“I was quoted once as saying this was the stallion that became a gelding and now she’s a mare,” she said.

“I do have to say that I have now found myself to be a member. So I have come full circle.”

As an MP, Beyer played a pivotal role decriminalising prostitution, credited with changing a handful of votes on the bill which passed 60 votes to 59.

“On the third reading of the Prostitution Reform Act, I got up and said, ‘I will assume Mr Speaker that I am the only person in this chamber who has ever worked in the sex industry’,” she said.

“I paused and looked around to see whose hands were going to go flying up. Of course there weren’t any. In that moment I guess they gave me tacit approval that I was the expert on this thing in this chamber.”

Beyer also suffered greatly during her life, alleging she was “brutalised, exploited and pack raped” during her time as a sex worker in Sydney.

“I’ve had to endure that kind of thing and it either kills you or it doesn’t. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” she said.

In 2020, Beyer was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the rainbow community.

The Wairarapa MP Kieran McAnulty, who was baby sat by Beyer as a child, said New Zealand had “lost a great one”.

“She was a beloved family member, loyal friend, passionate advocate for the LGBTIQA+ community and a powerhouse of a local politician,” he said.

“I met up with her two weeks ago to chat about her battle with kidney disease, something that my family have also been affected by. Her spark was still very much intact.”

The New Zealand prime minister, Chris Hipkins, also offered his condolences, saying Beyer left a “lasting impression on the parliament”.

## 207, New Zealand gun laws face scrutiny after Christchurch attack

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/new-zealand-gun-laws-face-scrutiny-after-christchurch-attack

> Unlike UK and Australia there is no ban on semi-automatic military-style weapons

New Zealand shooting – latest updates


The toll of 49 dead and more injured in mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques has put renewed scrutiny on New Zealand’s gun laws, particularly the debate over restrictions on military-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, which are frequently used in mass shootings worldwide.

Civilians in New Zealand own an estimated 1.2m firearms, according to the 2017 Small Arms Survey. That makes New Zealand’s per capita rate of gun ownership higher than Australia’s, but still far below the US, where there is more than one gun per person in civilian ownership.

The Christchurch shootings highlight “the disparity between New Zealand gun laws and those of other developed nations”, said Philip Alpers, an Australian researcher and the founding director of GunPolicy.org, which tracks gun laws worldwide.

Unlike the UK and Australia, New Zealand does not ban the ownership of semi-automatic assault weapons. Most guns can be legally sold on the internet or through newspaper ads. Any person aged 16 or over with an entry-level firearm licence can keep any number of common rifles and shotguns without having to register them.

“New Zealand’s decision not to register 96% of civilian firearms makes it a standout exception, alone with the United States and Canada,” Alpers said.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said after Friday’s massacre that she would tighten the country’s gun laws, and that she would consider banning semi-automatic weapons altogether.

“I can tell you one thing right now. Our gun laws will change,” she said.

There has been renewed debate in New Zealand over the past year about what police say are loopholes in the way military-style semi-automatic (MSSA) rifles are defined by law. Possession of MSSA rifles is supposed to be subject to a higher level of scrutiny, and there are only about 15,000 registered in civilian hands in 2018.

The legal definition of MSSA firearms, however, means that guns with slightly different features but virtually the same function fall outside the stricter regulations. Both police and firearms enthusiasts noted that a rifle could be transformed into an MSSA simply by adding a larger-capacity magazine.

A review of New Zealand’s gun laws commissioned by police officials in 1997 recommended that MSSA rifles be banned and subject to a mandatory buyback. None of the review’s recommendations were adopted, Alpers said.

The country’s gun laws are largely unchanged since 1992, when controls were tightened after the 1990 Aramoana massacre, in which a man killed 13 people with a semi-automatic rifle.

A briefing document sent recently to a New Zealand minister complained that gaps in the law had already been exploited in violent incidents, and noted that “purchase of high-capacity magazines is unregulated and does not require a firearms licence”, Stuff.co.nz reported last year.

The country’s former prime minister Helen Clark called for tougher gun laws on Friday. Speaking to ABC News she said: “We do have gun control. People have to be fit and proper persons to have guns, but undoubtedly the law can be strengthened and improved.

“Personally, I would be surprised if the New Zealand parliament didn’t accept that challenge head on to strengthen the law. I think we could do better and a tragedy like this brings that forward as a priority.”

## 208, Fury as Australian senator blames Christchurch attack on Muslim immigration

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/australian-senator-fraser-anning-criticised-blaming-new-zealand-attack-on-muslim-immigration

> Politicians rebuke Fraser Anning over comments after New Zealand mosque attack

New Zealand shooting – latest updates


An Australian senator has been strongly criticised after he blamed the New Zealand shooting on Muslim immigration.

Following the attack, which left 49 people dead at two mosques in Christchurch, Fraser Anning tweeted: “Does anyone still dispute the link between Muslim immigration and violence?”

In a statement shared by an Australian journalist on Twitter, the Queensland senator also wrote: “As always, leftwing politicians and the media will rush to claim that the causes of today’s shootings lie with gun laws or those who hold nationalist views, but this is all cliched nonsense.

“The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.”

The remarks were denounced by the UK home secretary, Sajid Javid, who accused the senator of stoking extremism.

“At a time for grieving and reflection, this Australian senator … fans the flames of violence and extremism,” he tweeted.

“Australians will be utterly ashamed of this racist man. In no way does he represent our Australian friends.”

Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said: “The remarks by Senator Fraser Anning blaming the murderous attacks by a violent, rightwing, extremist terrorist in New Zealand on immigration are disgusting. Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian parliament.”

The former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull wrote: “Fraser Anning’s comments today are contemptible. He is a disgrace to the Senate and, what is worse, by spreading hatred and turning Australians against each other, he is doing exactly what the terrorists want.”

Tony Burke, a frontbencher in Australia’s Labor party, said Anning’s comments amounted to “hate speech” and were “horrific and sick”.

Burke told Australia’s ABC that “the normalisation of bigotry is something that is not only confined to him … We need to call it out, we need to make sure that no way any member of parliament fosters it. He wants the conflict and he wants the notoriety”.

> Forty killed in shootings at two Christchurch mosques … Brexit delayed, parties split … and the flight delay that saved a man’s life

Good morning – this is Alison Rourke bringing you the last briefing of the week, with a terrible story from New Zealand leading the news.

New Zealand is reeling after shootings at two mosques during Friday prayers in the centre of the city of Christchurch killed 40 people. Twenty more were seriously injured. Police are still piecing together exactly what happened but we know that a gunman entered Al Noor mosque at 1.40pm local time and began firing. There was also shooting at a second mosque in the city, the Linwood Islamic Centre. A video was circulating online, which purported to show the attack from the perspective of the shooter.

New Zealand’s police commissioner warned people not to go to mosques “under any circumstances” today and the city centre was locked down while the emergency played out. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said: “Clearly, what has happened here is an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence.” She added that many of those directly affected by the shooting “may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home.”

The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed that one of the men in police custody was Australian-born. You can follow updates on this unfolding story here.

Brexit delay – Article 50 is set to be extended by at least three months after parliament overwhelmingly voted for more time. Theresa May, facing a bitterly divided cabinet, ministry and party will bring her deal, which has been comprehensively defeated in parliament twice, back for a third time on Tuesday. If it passes, she will ask for a short, technical extension of article 50 to 30 June at the European summit next Thursday. If she is defeated again, Brexit could face a much longer delay. There are many balls in the air and you can read some of the possible scenarios that could play out here.

The split in May’s cabinet during the article 50 vote was stark. Eight ministers, including the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, voted against the government’s motion to extend, preferring to keep the threat of no deal in place. In total, more than half of Tory MPs voted against the motion. You can see how your MP voted here.

The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, was scathing about the Tory splits: “This evening the Brexit secretary voted against his government’s own motion on Brexit, which earlier in the day he had defended in the House of Commons. That’s the equivalent of the chancellor voting against his own budget. This is a government that has completely lost control.” But his own party’s divisions over Brexit were also clearly on display. Labour whipped its MPs to abstain on an amendment calling for a second referendum – but 24 Labour MPs defied the whips to vote for it; and 17 rebelled to vote against, including several frontbenchers.

In an apparent shift in the EU’s red lines, the European council president, Donald Tusk, suggested even before MPs had voted that a lengthy extension beyond 29 March could be granted simply to give Westminster time to recalibrate.

Climate strikes – Thousands of British school children are expected to leave their classrooms today to join a global movement demanding action on climate change. More than 100 countries will see walkouts which began last year when one teenager – Greta Thunberg – held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. You can follow our live blog of events here, and be sure to check in for George Monbiot’s live web chat from 10am.

David Steel suspension – The former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Lord Steel, has been suspended from the party after admitting he was aware that Cyril Smith was a child abuser but he failed launch an investigation. It follows an outcry over the peer’s testimony to an inquiry that in 1979 the late MP for Rochdale confirmed reports that he had assaulted children. Party officials decided last night that Steel should have the whip withdrawn and face a formal investigation.

Still with the Liberal Democrats, and the party’s leader Sir Vince Cable has announced he will stand down in May but will remain an MP and intends to write books. It follows criticism of his lacklustre performance over Brexit.

Make Mueller public – The US House of Representatives has voted unanimously to make Robert Mueller’s final report available publicly. However, questions remain as to whether such a vote could pass the Republican-controlled Senate. The non-binding resolution shows bipartisan support in the lower house. Donald Trump has repeatedly called the inquiry, which is expected to wind up soon, a “hoax” and a “witch-hunt”.

‘Fourth emergency service’ – Schools are supporting offering food parcels, clothing and laundry facilities to vulnerable families in England and Wales, according to a new report by a headteachers’ union. Sarah Bone, headteacher of Headlands school, a comprehensive in Yorkshire’s East Riding, said they had far too many children with “no food in the cupboards, washing themselves with cold water, walking to school with holes in their shoes … and living on one hot meal a day provided at school”. Other heads reported pupils with no winter coats, while others said they regularly had to buy shoes for their pupils.

Antonis Mavropoulos knows he is lucky. He missed boarding the doomed Ethiopian Airlines crash last Sunday because he was late to the gate – by two minutes. “I could see a guy in a green T-shirt and others boarding and I shouted to also be let in,” he says, his voice cracking with emotion. “I’ve found it very difficult to sleep since.”

Mavropoulos, a Greek chemical engineer, says he feels he has a moral obligation to uncover why the plane went down, killing all 157 people onboard. “As the guy who was saved just by luck I want to say something very clear,” he says. “The souls of these people, the people who I saw and all those who died, can never be relieved unless there are concrete answers and the truth is uncovered.”

Arsenal overhauled a two-goal deficit from the first leg against Rennes to book a place in Europa League quarter-finals, while Chelsea’s Olivier Giroud scored a perfect hat trick in a 5-0 romp at Dynamo Kyiv for an 8-0 aggregate win.

Warren Gatland has told Eddie Jones to mind his own business after the England coach said Wales looked “tired” before their Six Nations decider with Ireland in Cardiff.

Rory McIlroy has said it is “only a matter of time” before Tommy Fleetwood wins a tournament in the United States after the Englishman shot a first-round 65 in the Players Championship.

Mikaela Shiffrin won the World Cup super-G title for her 10th career crystal globe, and Dominik Paris secured the men’s title by winning the season-ending race at the World Cup finals.

Paul Farbrace has begun life as Warwickshire’s new director of sport but England’s recently departed assistant coach is already eyeing a reunion with Trevor Bayliss.

The influential Investment Association, which represents 250 firms with £7.7tn in assets under management, has written to more than 60 publicly listed companies with only a single female director, including Domino’s Pizza and JD Sports, raising concerns over a lack of gender diversity and warning of a backlash if progress is stalled. Targets set by the government-commissioned Hampton-Alexander review aimed for women to make up at least 33% of FTSE350 boards and leadership teams by 2020. “Investors have been consistently clear that they want to see greater diversity in the boardroom so it is totally unacceptable that one in five of the UK’s biggest companies are falling so far short,” said Chris Cummings, the IA’s CEO.

Asian stocks made modest gains on Friday, tracking improved global sentiment after the UK voted to delay Brexit. The pound was buying $1.325 and €1.170.

The front pages have mixed feelings about the decision to extend article 50. “Failures” is the Express’s headline, under a letter from “We the people” which demands “YOU, our servants” fulfil the outcome of the Brexit referendum. The Telegraph says this is the PM’s “Last roll of the dice”. The FT says the vote to extend “boosts May’s hand” in pushing through her Brexit deal.

The Times and the Guardian play it straight, with: “May to ask for Brexit delay” and “MPs vote overwhelmingly to delay Brexit” respectively. The i has “Brexit delayed”.

The Mirror, the Mail and the Sun decline to lead on Brexit. “Knife thugs cheat justice” is the Mirror’s lead story and the Mail has “David Steel suspended over child sex scandal”. The Sun leads on a “second tragedy” for the 1D singer: “Louis sis dead at 18” is its main headline.

## 210, Australian media broadcast footage from Christchurch shootings despite police pleas

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/australian-media-broadcast-footage-from-christchurch-shootings-despite-police-pleas

> Sky News Australia broadcast footage of the shooter at the mosque and Ten Daily embedded footage on website and social media posts

Christchurch shooting: latest updates


As New Zealand police and social media platforms scrambled to remove video of the Christchurch shootings – apparently live-streamed by one of the perpetrators – from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, several Australian media outlets broadcast some of the footage.

“Police are aware there is extremely distressing footage relating to the incident in Christchurch circulating online,” the police said in a statement. “We would strongly urge that the link not be shared. We are working to have any footage removed.”

Police are aware there is extremely distressing footage relating to the incident in Christchurch circulating online. We would strongly urge that the link not be shared. We are working to have any footage removed.

Facebook, which carried the live-stream from the shooter on Friday, co-operated with New Zealand police and deleted the shooter’s accounts.

Sky News Australia repeatedly broadcast footage of the shooter at the mosque and Ten Daily embedded the footage on its website and social media posts. Neither showed the actual shootings or any victims.

The Ten Daily video remained online for several hours but was eventually taken down, along with all the stills from the video. Sky continued to show excerpts from the video.

Ten Daily have embedded part of the alleged livestream with pre-roll, advertising a new show they have with the Bondi Vet. https://t.co/oNWfPzDprf

A Sky spokeswoman said: “Sky News in line with other broadcasters ran heavily edited footage that did not show the shootings or the victims.”

Ten have been approached for comment.

The New Zealand massacre was livestreamed on Facebook, announced on 8chan, reposted on YouTube, commentated about on Reddit, and mirrored around the world before the tech companies could even react.

News.com.au published stills from the shooter’s video and included some footage from the gunman in his car and entering the mosque in an online video.

Channel Nine used some of the shooter’s footage, but stopped the video before the gunman entered the mosque.

The Herald-Sun promoted the video as “Gunman’s horrifying video inside New Zealand mosque”. But it stops the moment he enters the mosque.

The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, reiterated the police’s plea in a later media conference.

“We should not be perpetuating, sharing, giving any oxygen to this act of violence and the message that is sitting behind it,” Ardern said. “What all of us can at least do is ensure that we do not share, spread or actively engage in that message of hate. We have been given assurance that … at least those platforms where some of those images have been shared, are actively being removed. But I just ask people, don’t share them.”

Australia’s opposition leader, Bill Shorten, also urged people not to watch or share the footage.

“I found the advice of the New Zealand police force to be particularly wise,” he said.

“They have said, and I agree, do not allow this evil into our lives. Do not share the footage. Do not watch the footage. This is not part of normal life.

“The people who have committed this atrocity have wanted the attention. We should never normalise this. Do not share the footage. Do not watch the footage.”

Facebook says it alerts authorities to threats of violence or violence as soon as it becomes aware through reports or Facebook tools.

“Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this horrendous act,” Facebook executive for Australia and New Zealand, Mia Garlick, said.

“New Zealand police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the live-stream commenced and we quickly removed both the shooter’s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video.

“We’re also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we’re aware. We will continue working directly with New Zealand police as their response and investigation continues.”

The social media site uses a combination of technology, reports from the Facebook community and human review to remove any violating content.

The apparent manifesto of the shooter, which has been removed from his social media accounts, was shared by several media outlets, including ABC News, which read out an excerpt.

## 211, UK Muslim leaders urge protection for mosques after Christchurch

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/15/uk-muslim-leaders-urge-protection-for-mosques-after-christchurch

> Islamophobia warning comes as UK police step up patrols after New Zealand terror attack

New Zealand shooting – latest updates


Muslim leaders in the UK have called on the government to redouble its efforts to ensure the country’s mosques are protected in the wake of the shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, as they said worshippers attending Friday prayers would be doing so in the face of “unabated Islamophobia”.

The warning came as British police stepped up patrols in Muslim areas and around places of worship in direct response to the terrorist attack, in which at least 49 people were killed and 48 injured.

About 100 counter-terrorism investigations are already under way to thwart extreme rightwing terror plots in Britain and those who might help them, the Guardian understands.

Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, assistant commissioner Neil Basu, condemned the Christchurch attacks and said: “Today we will be stepping up reassurance patrols around mosques and increasing engagement with communities of all faith, giving advice on how people and places can protect themselves.”

Friday lunchtime is the main time of the week for Muslim prayers, when many mosques across the UK are busy.

Basu said UK experts were ready to support local authorities and that UK-based threats were also under constant review. He added: “Together with our intelligence partners we continually monitor the varied threats we face, including to and around places of worship and specific communities across the country, to ensure we have the most appropriate protective security measures in place to keep people safe.”

But amid persistent concerns about Islamophobia, Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), said Muslims were being forced to live in fear. “As the rest of us prepare to undertake our own Friday prayers today, we do so with the anxiety as to whether our mosques and communities are safe in the face of unabated Islamophobia and hostility against Muslims,” he said.

Khan also urged the Home Office to allow applications for its worship security fund to resume. Launched in 2016, the scheme helps churches, mosques, temples and gurdwaras to install alarms, security lighting and CCTV cameras. Bids for up to £56,000 per place of worship could be submitted between June and August last year.

The MCB also gave examples of the rise of Islamophobia and rightwing extremism in the UK, saying that in the last two months alone, two mosques in Newcastle and Manchester had been attacked by vandals who spray-painted Nazi swastika symbols.

On Friday, a mosque in Birmingham asked police for increased security after concerned worshippers contacted managers fearing similar attacks.

Kamran Hussain, the general manager of the Green Lane Mosque and Community Centre, spoke with counter terrorism officers asking them to provide an additional police presence during afternoon prayers following calls from the congregation.

Pensioner Mohammed Saleem, 82, was stabbed to death yards from his home, after attending prayers at the Green Lane mosque in 2013. The white supremacist terrorist, Pavlo Lapshyn, was jailed for life for the racially motivated murder.

Hussain said: “For those that may be worried about attending Friday prayers at the Masjid today, we have contacted the police for additional security. We are expecting additional presence from them. The general message to the community is to stay calm but vigilant.

“People have a lot of questions and we want to ensure they feel safe,” he added.

Meanwhile, Mohammed Kozbar, the general secretary of the Finsbury Park mosque in north London where Makram Ali was killed in an extremist attack in June 2017, criticised the Conservative party for its alleged role in fuelling Islamophobia in the UK.

Kozbar said: “They don’t recognise their problems within the party. It is not just the Conservative party but it is spreading in wider society as well.

“These far-right people are given the platform to spread this without being challenged. This is a disease and unless we deal with it in a strong way and tackle it in a proper way, this will result in similar incidents to what happened in New Zealand.”

The New Zealand attacker’s “manifesto” referenced the Finsbury Park attacker, Darren Osborne.

Worshippers in the West Midlands and Greater Manchester, both areas with a large Muslim population, were also being offered extra protection.

Assistant chief constable Matt Ward from West Midlands police said officers would be engaging with key religious buildings to reassure local people. “As we are all very aware we face a sustained and determined threat to our security,” he added.

He said that while there was no specific threat, “we appreciate that our local communities may have concerns”.

“I would like to reassure you that there is no increased threat to the people of the West Midlands.”

The far-right terror threat came to government and mainstream attention after the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox in June 2016.

Last year, the Home Office released figures that showed the number of recorded hate crimes more than doubled in the past five years.

The monitoring group Tell Mama said there was a record number of anti-Muslim attacks and incidents of abuse reported in 2017, with women disproportionately targeted by mostly male, teenage perpetrators.

In its annual report, the group noted a surge in the number of Islamaphobic attacks, with 1,201 verified reports submitted in 2017, a rise of 26% on the year before and the highest number since it began recording incidents.

Iman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, said anti-Muslim sentiment was “becoming a global issue and a binding factor for extremist far-right groups and individuals”.

“It is a threat that needs to be taken seriously,” she added.

The security minister, Ben Wallace, sought to reassure British Muslim communities, saying: “Later today, the home secretary and I will be speaking to police counter-terrorism leaders and security services to discuss what further measures we can take to protect our mosques and our communities from any threat here in the United Kingdom.

“A terrorist is a terrorist and we shall deal with them exactly the same.”

## 212, 'The time has come': Ardern apologises for New Zealand's worst air disaster

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/mount-erebus-plane-crash-ardern-apologises-40-years-after-air-new-zealand-crash-that-killed-257

> PM sorry for state-owned Air New Zealand’s efforts to blame pilots for 1979 crash into Antarctica’s Mt Erebus 

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has met the relatives of those killed in the Erebus disaster – New Zealand’s worst plane crash which claimed 257 lives – and offered the first apology by any government.

It is 40 years since a plane belonging to national carrier Air New Zealand crashed into Mount Erebus, a volcano, on a scenic tour of Antarctica. The crash was the worst in the country’s aviation history and on Thursday the Ardern said Erebus remained an unparalleled tragedy in Kiwi minds.

“In 1979 so much was lost; and the ramifications were immense. And time hasn’t necessarily diminished any of that,” Ardern said. “That loss, in and of itself, was huge. It sent ripples across the country, and trauma that those who weren’t directly affected would probably struggle to fathom.”

“But that loss and grief was compounded. It was undeniably worsened by the events that followed,” she said, referring to the subsequent investigation.

Years of inconclusive and murky inquiries led to accusations from grieving families that Air New Zealand was attempting a cover-up by blaming pilot error – a theory a 1981 royal commission of inquiry debunked, saying the crash was down to a whiteout and the plane’s navigational route being changed without the pilots being informed.

Aviation experts say improved technology, such as better satellite equipment and weather data means a similar disaster would not occur today.

The crash remains New Zealand’s worst peacetime disaster, and because of the country’s size – just 3 million at the time – a large portion of the population was affected, with current transport minister Phil Twyford describing it as an event “that changed our nation” forever.

At this moment on this day 40 years ago Air New Zealand Flight TE901 crashed into Mt Erebus killing all 257 passengers and crew — Aotearoa New Zealand’s worst civil disaster in history. Ka maumahara. We remember. #MtErebus40 #OTD #history pic.twitter.com/qxyTbJRl9N

The head of the royal inquiry at the time, judge Peter Mahon, described the airline’s participation in the inquiry as “an orchestrated litany of lies” leaving victims’ families not only grieving, but angry.

Ardern apologised wholeheartedly on behalf of the airline on Thursday, which was then wholly state-owned.

“After 40 years, on behalf of today’s government, the time has come to apologise for the actions of an airline then in full state ownership; which ultimately caused the loss of the aircraft and the loss of those you loved,” Ardern said. “This apology is whole-hearted and wide-reaching. We will never know your grief, but I know the time has come to say I am sorry.”

The Air New Zealand chair, Dame Therese Walsh, also offered her apologies to the families, a few hundred of whom had gathered at the Auckland memorial event.

“I apologise on behalf of an airline which 40 years ago failed in its duty of care to its passengers and staff,” Walsh said. “And I apologise again on behalf of the airline for the way in which the families of those lost on Mount Erebus were treated in the aftermath of the accident. Better care should have been taken of you.”

Forty years on there remains no memorial to the Erebus disaster, and plans to erect one in the Auckland suburb of Parnell face strident opposition, with some saying it would be too “sad” for local residents.

## 213, ‘Our safety is a concern’: fears endure among Muslims after Christchurch attacks

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/our-safety-is-a-concern-fears-endure-among-muslims-after-christchurch-attacks

> Despite attempts to address online hate speech in New Zealand and global praise at the response, an estimated 60-70 far-right groups still exist

“They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not,” said Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s leader, in the hours after a terrorist attack in March last year that killed 51 people and injured dozens more at two mosques in the country’s worst peacetime massacre. “They have no place in New Zealand. There is no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme and unprecedented violence.”

The mass shooting in Christchurch, a remote, peaceful corner of the world, reverberated around the globe – shocking in its brutality, violence and the white-supremacist hatred that inspired it. Afterwards, it was overtaken by the remarkable compassion and unity of New Zealand’s response.

But while the year since the attacks has heralded a ban on semi-automatic weapons and attempts to address hate speech on and offline, it has also seen white supremacists emboldened. A threat to one of the targeted Christchurch mosques surfaced on social media just days before the one-year anniversary of the shooting.

“There’s certainly been a continuation of verbal and physical abuse and online hate that died down for maybe a month or two [after the attack],” says Anjum Rahman, a spokesperson for the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand, which had tried to alert the highest levels of government about a rising tide of far-right threats before the 15 March shooting.

“It’s certainly back up at pretty high levels and we still feel that our safety is a concern.”

A 19-year-old man appeared in court this month in relation to an alleged threat and a photo of Christchurch’s Al Noor mosque posted on the messaging platform Telegram, and several others have been charged after sharing the mosque shooting video, which was banned in New Zealand.

New far-right activist groups have emerged since the attack. Professor Paul Spoonley, a researcher at Massey University, estimates there are now about 60 to 70 such groups, and between 150 and 300 far-right activists, in New Zealand.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, leaders exhorted the public not to allow the episode to change anything about New Zealand’s way of life, but many Muslims around the country say change was badly needed. The biggest opportunity New Zealanders have been offered in the year since, they say, has been the chance to think and act differently.

“People have been willing to challenge their unconscious biases and think about how those biases can change into something bigger and more deeply rooted,” says Sondos Qur’aan, 19, a law student at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, and a member of Al Noor mosque. She has advocated on behalf of the affected families.

The attacks upended New Zealanders’ understanding of racism and terrorism, with the public willing to refer to white supremacist attacks as terrorism for the first time, she adds.

“A lot of people’s biases are coming out and it’s really a chance to realise: ‘Hold on. We’re not as bad as the people who go out and do something violent, but we can contribute to it with these narratives and ideologies that we hold inside of us,’” Qur’aan says.

The attack placed the country – which had rarely encountered terrorism, and had not seriously confronted white supremacy – at the centre of an online web of far-right extremism. The fact that the Christchurch gunman appeared to have posted a live video of the shootings on Facebook provoked criticism of social media platforms.

Ardern eschewed domestic restrictions on tech giants, instead – along with Emmanuel Macron of France – generating a global pledge, the Christchurch Call, between world leaders, technology companies, and civil society platforms.

The voluntary accord included new protocols for tech platforms to work together and with governments in the event of a terrorist attack. But some analysts from civil society groups who attended meetings cast doubt on whether the measures would keep Muslims safer.

“If what they were responding to was an attack on the Muslim community, they could have done a better job of addressing that kind of terrorism, instead of immediately partnering with France and a number of companies that have a very different working definition of terrorism,” says Jillian C York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

“I personally feel that restrictions – whether they’re from companies or big bodies like the EU or the US – that have global implications, that have implications for other people’s cultural contexts, are more problematic than national regulations,” she adds.

But some actions taken by New Zealand’s government drew global praise. Six days after the attack, Ardern announced the country would ban semi-automatic weapons – including all those used by the gunman – and a law was passed less than a month later, with 119 of the parliament’s 120 lawmakers in favour.

Some 56,000 weapons were turned over to the police in the following six months, although it was not known how many semi-automatic guns there were in New Zealand to begin with, so the success of the scheme was difficult to assess. A second tranche of proposed gun laws will allow police to deny or revoke firearms licences on the basis of extreme posts on social media.

This year, Ardern’s government has planned more a controversial change: a proposed new law to curb hate speech, which Anjum Rahman says is unlikely to find enough support.

“There are quite a few political actors who use inflammatory rhetoric to get votes,” she says, adding that she fears “desperate” minor parties might deploy anti-Muslim rhetoric ahead of September’s election.

An independent inquiry is underway into whether action by New Zealand’s government agencies could have prevented the attack, and is due to publish a report in April. Many Muslims are anxious to see accountability and consequences for any failings found.

“A lot of people might have this idea that we’ve done this much, that’s enough,” says Qur’aan. “We should acknowledge how far we’ve come but not just stop there. We must continue with that change.”



## 214, New Zealand stabbings: new law to close loophole to pass in September, says Ardern

> PM says supermarket terrorist had fraudulent refugee status amid warnings against kneejerk reactions

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said that a legal loophole which allowed an Islamic State-inspired terrorist to remain free will be closed off with new legislation by the end of September.

The country had tried for years to deport Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, a 32-year-old Sri Lankan man who was shot dead by police following Friday’s attack at a supermarket in Auckland. Seven people were hurt in the attack, five of them with stab wounds. Three of those injured were in a critical condition in hospital on Saturday.

Samsudeen was fighting to keep his refugee status in New Zealand when he carried out the attack, which Ardern said was inspired by the Islamic State.

Officials had tried to detain Samsudeen in jail until his asylum case was resolved but there were no legal grounds for doing so. Instead, 30 officers watched him around the clock for more than 50 days before he grabbed a knife from a supermarket shelf and attacked shoppers, metres away from the undercover police surveilling him.

The attack provoked fresh debate about a proposed law change currently before parliament that would make the act of planning a terrorist attack a crime – a legal gap identified after the Christchurch shooting. The government has vowed to fast-track this reform in the wake of Friday’s attack.

“We are still working to have that legislation passed before the end of the month,” Ardern said at a news conference. “The really helpful thing is it has already gone through substantial public consultation so people have already had their say and we haven’t needed to rush that process. Now what we will do is go through that procedural process in parliament a little quickly.”

Samsudeen had fraudulently secured refugee status, Ardern said, and his status as a “protected person” barred his deportation to Sri Lanka.

Ardern said the government had tried to keep Samsudeen out of the community, including looking at whether he could be sectioned under the Mental Health Act, due to his history of mental illness.

“I was later advised that prevention orders could not be used and that he had refused psychological assessment,” Ardern said.

Speaking to RNZ, counter-terrorism expert Paul Buchanan questioned why the act had not been used to detain the man.

But the chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation, Shaun Robinson, said the act was there to help people get well, not to be used as stopgap to fill holes in the criminal law.

Statements that the act should have been used in this case equate violent activity and extremist beliefs or action with mental illness, Robinson said.

“Extremist beliefs are not a mental illness, they are a choice that people make and expose themselves to repeatedly, whether they be white-supremacist ideologies; whether they be Islamic State inspired.”

While Samsudeen may have had mental health problems that made him more vulnerable to radical ideologies, there are many others who act on ideologies without evidence of mental illness, he said.

“It’s wrong to just conflate it all together. It is also wrong to assume that if this man had had treatment for his mental distress, that would have prevented this terrorist [attack].”

Amnesty International said Samsudeen’s case involved civil and criminal proceedings and touched on several international conventions.

“A complex case like this should not be used to make blanket law in the heat of the moment,” said Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand executive director, Meg de Ronde.

“Especially law that has the potential to harm vulnerable people or restrict civil liberties. Big decisions should not be rammed through during times of crisis.”

On Sunday, the deputy prime minister, Grant Robertson, said the government had explored every legal avenue to keep the community safe.

“We have at every turn … gone to every part of the law.”

Robertson said a person could not be detained under the Immigration Act for anything other than deportation. “We are looking at the full sweep of the Immigration Act,” he said.

“If we were to change that there is a very significant move and would need quite a lot of consideration.”

The cabinet is considering the possibility of a wider investigation after the man’s death. There were a range of reviews that are possible, Robertson said.

But other MPs are cautioning against a kneejerk reaction. The Green party’s immigration spokesperson, Golriz Ghahraman, told RNZ she was apprehensive of any law change that would make it easier to deport someone who was granted refugee status.

“We’re actually doing something that’s pretty serious and pretty kneejerk in terms of whether it would ever have addressed any of the issues that come about when we’re talking about radicalisation here in New Zealand,” Ghahraman said. “It’s really missing the point and doing something that’s dangerous.”

She said the focus should be on rehabilitation rather than immigration status.
