## Dependencies 

- `clang` 
- llvm (the `llvm` in the llvm-project)
- `cmake`
- `lit`  
  - `lit` is distributed by Pypi instead LLVM official repostory. 

## Makefile 

```bash
mkdir build & cd build 
CC=/usr/local/bin/clang CXX=/usr/local/bin/clang++ cmake -DLT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR="/usr/local" ..
make
```

Note that **macOS** will not allow undefined symbols in compile time (but at runtime, these undefined symbols could be meaningful as LLVM allows us to dynamically load passes), so we have to add `-undefined dynamic_lookup` to the target flag. See more in `FunctionInfo/lib/CMakeLists.txt `
